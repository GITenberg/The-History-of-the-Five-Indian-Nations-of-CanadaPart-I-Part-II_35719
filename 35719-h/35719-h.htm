<h2>G E N E R A L</h2>

<h1><i>O G L E T H O R P E</i>.</h1>

<i>SIR,</i>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he <i>Indian</i> Affairs have ever appeared to your judgment of such
Importance to the Welfare of our own People, that you have ever
carefully applied your Thoughts to them; and that with such Success,
that not only the present Generation will enjoy the Benefit of your
Care, but our latest Posterity bless your Memory for that Happiness the
Foundation of which was laid under your Care, provided that the People
here, whose Duty and Interest is chiefly concerned, do on their own
Parts second your Endeavours, towards securing the Peace, and advancing
the Prosperity of their Country.</p>

<p>The following Account of the <i>Five Indian Nations</i> will shew what
dangerous Neighbours the <i>Indians</i> have once been; what Pains a
neighbouring Colony (whose Interest is opposite to ours) has taken to
withdraw their Affections from us; and how much we ought to be on our
Guard. If we only consider the Riches which our Enemies receive from the
<i>Indian Trade</i> (though we were under no Apprehensions from the <i>Indians</i>
themselves) it would be highly imprudent in us to suffer such People to
grow Rich and Powerful, while it is in our Power to prevent it, with
much less Charge and Trouble, than it is in theirs to accomplish their
Designs.</p>

<p>These Considerations alone are sufficient to make the <i>Indian Affairs</i>
deserve the most serious Thoughts of every Governor in <i>America</i>. But I
well know, besides; that your Excellency's views are not confined to the
Interest of one Country only.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> are a poor and, generally called, barbarous People,
bred under the darkest Ignorance; and yet a bright and noble Genius
shines through these black Clouds. None of the greatest <i>Roman</i> Heroes
have discovered a greater Love to their Country, or a greater Contempt
of Death, than these people called Barbarians have done, when Liberty
came in Competition. Indeed, I think our <i>Indians</i> have outdone the
<i>Romans</i> in this Particular; some of the greatest of those have we know
murdered themselves to avoid Shame or Torments; but our <i>Indians</i> have
refused to die meanly, or with but little Pain, when they thought their
Country's Honour would be at stake by it<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; but have given their
Bodies, willingly, to the most cruel Torments of their Enemies, to shew,
as they said, that the <i>Five Nations</i> consisted of Men, whose Courage
and Resolution could not be shaken. They greatly sully, however, those
noble virtues, by that cruel Passion, Revenge; this they think is not
only lawful, but honourable, to exert without Mercy on their Country's
Enemies, and for this only it is that they can deserve the Name of
Barbarians.</p>

<p>But what, alas! Sir, have we Christians done to make them better? We
have indeed Reason to be ashamed, that these Infidels, by our
Conversation and Neighbourhood, are become worse than they were before
they knew us. Instead of virtues we have only taught them Vices, that
they were intirely free from before that Time. The narrow Views of
private Interest have occasioned this, and will occasion greater, even
publick Mischiefs, if the Governors of the People do not, like true
Patriots, exert themselves, and put a stop to these growing Evils. If
these Practices be winked at, instead of faithful Friends, that have
manfully fought our Battles for us, the <i>Five Nations</i> will become
faithless Thieves and Robbers, and join with every Enemy that can give
them any Hopes of Plunder.</p>

<p>If Care were taken to plant and cultivate in them that general
Benevolence to Mankind, which is the true first Principle of virtue, it
would effectually eradicate those horrid Vices, occasioned by their
unbounded Revenge; and then they would no longer deserve the Name of
Barbarians, but would become a People, whose Friendship might add Honour
to the <i>British</i> Nation.</p>

<p>The <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, Sir, once as much Barbarians as our <i>Indians</i>
now are, deified the Heroes that first taught them those virtues, from
whence the Grandeur of those renowned Nations wholly proceeded; a good
Man, however, will feel more real Satisfaction and Pleasure, from the
Sense of having any Way forwarded the Civilizing of a barbarous Nation,
or of having multiplied the Number of good Men, than from the fondest
Hopes of such extravagant Honours.</p>

<p>These Considerations, I believe, will induce you, Sir, to think a
History of the <i>Five Nations</i> not unworthy of your Patronage; and on
these only it is that I presume to offer my best Endeavours in this, who
am, with the greatest Respect,</p>

<h1>P R E F A C E</h1>

<h3>TO THE</h3>

<h2><span class="smcap">F i r s t&nbsp; P a r t</span>.</h2>


<p><i><span class="dropcap">T</span>hough every one that is in the least acquainted with the Affairs of</i>
North-America, <i>knows of what Consequence the</i> Indians, <i>commonly known to
the People of</i> New-York <i>by the Name of the</i> Five Nations, <i>are, both in
Peace and War; I know of no Accounts of them, published in</i> English,<i> but
what are very imperfect, and indeed meer Translations of</i> French <i>Authors,
who themselves know little of the Truth. This seems to throw some
Reflections on the Inhabitants of our Province, as if we wanted
Curiosity to enquire into our own Affairs, and were willing to rest
satisfied with the Accounts the</i> French <i>give us of our own</i> Indians,
<i>notwithstanding that the</i> French <i>in</i> Canada <i>are always in a different
Interest, and sometimes in open Hostility with us. This Consideration, I
hope, will justify my attempting to write an History of the</i> Five
Nations <i>at this Time; and having had the Perusal of the Minutes of the
Commissioners for</i> Indian Affairs, <i>I have been enabled to collect many
Materials for this History, which are not to be found any where else;
and cannot but think, that a History of this Kind will be of great Use
to all the British Colonies in</i> North-America, <i>since it may enable them
to learn Experience at the Expence of others: And if I can contribute
any Thing to so good a Purpose, I shall not think my Labour lost.</i></p>

<p><i>It will be necessary for me here to say something in Excuse of two
Things in the following Performance, which, I am afraid, will naturally
be found Fault with in it. The first is, the filling up so great Part of
the Work with the Adventures of small Parties, and sometimes with those
of one single Man: And the second is, the inserting so many Speeches at
length.</i></p>

<p><i>As to the first, the History of</i> Indians <i>would be very lame, without an
Account of these private Adventures; for their warlike Expeditions are
almost always carried on by surprising each other, and their whole Art
of War consists in managing small Parties. The whole Country being one
continued Forest, gives great Advantages to those skulking Parties, and
has obliged the Christians to imitate the</i> Indians <i>in this Method of
making War among them. And some would, doubtless, be desirous to know
the Manners and Customs of the</i> Indians, <i>in their publick Treaties
especially, who could not be satisfied without taking Notice of several
minute Circumstances, and Things otherwise of no Consequence. We are
fond of searching into remote Antiquity, to know the Manners of our
earliest Progenitors; and, if I am not mistaken, the</i> Indians <i>are living
Images of them.</i></p>

<p><i>My Design therefore in the second was, that thereby the Genius of the</i>
Indians <i>might appear. An Historian may paint Mens Actions in lively
Colours, or in faint Shades, as he likes best, and in both Cases
preserve a perfect Likeness; but it will be a difficult Task to shew
the Wit, Judgment, Art, Simplicity, and Ignorance of the several
Parties, managing a</i> Treaty, <i>in other Words than their own. As to my
Part, I thought myself incapable of doing it, without depriving the
judicious Observer of the Opportunity of discovering much of the</i> Indian
Genius, <i>by my contracting or paraphrasing their Harangues, and without
committing often gross Mistakes. For, on these Occasions, a skilful
Manager often talks confusedly, and obscurely, with Design; which if an
Historian should endeavour to amend, the Reader would receive the
History in a false Light.</i></p>

<p><i>The Reader will find a great Difference between some of the Speeches
here given of those made at</i> Albany<i>, and those taken from the</i> French
Authors. <i>Ours are genuine and truly related, as delivered by the sworn
Interpreters, of whom Truth only is required; a rough Stile, with Truth,
is preferable to Eloquence without it: This may be said in Justification
of the</i> Indian <i>Expression, though I must own, that I suspect our
Interpreters may not have done Justice to the</i> Indian <i>Eloquence. For the</i>
Indians <i>having but few Words, and few complex Ideas, use many Metaphors
in their Discourse, which interpreted by an unskilful Tongue, may appear
mean, and strike our Imagination faintly; but under the Pen of a skilful
Representer, might strongly move our Passions by their lively Images. I
have heard an old</i> Indian Sachem <i>speak with much Vivacity and Elocution,
so that the Speaker pleased and moved the Auditors with the Manner of
delivering his Discourse; which however, as it afterwards came from the
Interpreter, disappointed us in our Expectations. After the Speaker had
employed a considerable Time in haranguing with much Elocution, the
Interpreter often explained the whole by one single Sentence. I believe
the Speaker, in that Time, embellished and adorned his Figures, that
they might have their full Force on the Imagination, while the
Interpreter contented himself with the Sense, in as few Words as it
could be expressed.</i></p>

<p><i>He that first writes the History of Things, which are not generally
known, ought to avoid, as much as possible, to make the Evidence of the
Truth depend intirely on his own Veracity and Judgment; and for this
Reason I have related several Transactions in the Words of the
Registers, when this is once done, he that shall write afterwards, need
not act with so much Caution.</i></p>

<p><i>The History of these</i> Indians, <i>I promise myself, will give an agreeable
Amusement to many; almost every one will find something in it suited to
his own Palate; but every Line will not please every Man; on the
contrary, one will naturally approve what another condemns, as one
desires to know what another thinks not worth the Trouble of reading;
for which Reason, I think, it is better to run the Risque of being
sometimes tedious to certain Readers, than to omit any Thing that may be
useful to the World.</i></p>

<p><i>I have sometimes thought, that Histories wrote with all the Delicacy of
a fine Romance, are like</i> French <i>Dishes, more agreeable to the Palate
than the Stomach, and less wholesome than more common and coarser Diet.</i></p>

<p><i>An Historian's Views must be curious and extensive, and the History of
different People and different Ages requires different Rules, and often
different Abilities to write it; I hope therefore the Reader will, from
those Considerations, receive this first Attempt of this kind, with more
than usual Allowances.</i></p>

<p><i>The Inhabitants of</i> New-York <i>have been much more concerned in the
Transactions, which followed the Year</i> 1688, <i>than in those which preceded
it. And as it requires uncommon Courage and Resolution to engage
willingly in the Wars against a cruel and barbarous Enemy, I should be
sorry to forget any that might deserve to be remembered by their
Country, with Gratitude on that Occasion.</i></p>

<h3>THE</h3>

<h1>I N T R O D U C T I O N,</h1>

<h3>BEING</h3>

<h4><i>A short View of the Form of Government of the</i> Five Nations, <i>and of
their Laws, Customs</i>, &amp;c.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t is necessary to know something of the Form of Government of the
People, whose History one is about to know, and a few Words will be
sufficient to give the Reader a Conception of that of the <i>Five
Nations</i>, because it still remains under original Simplicity, and free
from those complicated Contrivances, which have become necessary to the
Nations, where Deceit and Cunning have increased as much as their
Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> (as their Name denotes) consist of so many Tribes or
Nations, joined together by a League or Confederacy, like the <i>United
Provinces</i>, and without any Superiority of the one over the other. This
Union has continued so long, that the Christians know nothing of the
Original of it: The People in it are known by the <i>English</i> under the
Names of <i>Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onondagas, Cayugas,</i> and <i>Sennekas.</i></p>

<p>Each of these Nations is again divided into three Tribes or Families,
who distinguish themselves by three different Arms or Ensigns, the
<i>Tortoise</i>, the <i>Bear</i>, and the <i>Wolf</i>; and the <i>Sachems</i>, or old Men of
these Families, put this Ensign, or Mark of their Family, to every
publick Paper, when they sign it.</p>

<p>Each of these Nations is an absolute Republick by itself, and every
Castle in each Nation makes an independent Republick, and is govern'd in
all publick Affairs by its own <i>Sachems</i> or old Men. The Authority of
these Rulers is gain'd by, and consists wholly in the Opinion the rest
of the Nation have of their Wisdom and Integrity. They never execute
their Resolutions by Force upon any of their People. Honour and Esteem
are their principal Rewards; as Shame, and being despised, their
Punishments. They have certain Customs, which they observe in their
publick Transactions with other Nations, and in their private Affairs
among themselves; which it is scandalous for any one among them not to
observe, and these always draw after them either publick or private
Resentment, whenever they are broke.</p>

<p>Their Leaders and Captains, in like Manner, obtain their Authority, by
the general Opinion of their Courage and Conduct, and lose it by a
failure in those Virtues.</p>

<p>Their great Men, both Sachems and Captains, are generally poorer than
the common People; for they affect to give away and distribute all the
Presents or Plunder they get in their Treaties or in War, so as to leave
nothing to themselves. There is not a Man in the Ministry of the <i>Five
Nations</i>, who has gain'd his Office, otherwise than by Merit; there is
not the least Salary, or any Sort of Profit, annexed to any Office, to
tempt the Covetous or Sordid; but, on the contrary, every unworthy
Action is unavoidably attended with the Forfeiture of their Commission;
for their Authority is only the Esteem of the People, and ceases the
Moment that Esteem is lost. Here we see the natural Origin of all Power
and Authority among a free People, and whatever artificial Power or
Sovereignty any Man may have acquired, by the Laws and Constitution of a
Country, his real Power will be ever much greater or less, in Proportion
to the Esteem the People have of him.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> think themselves by Nature superior to the rest of
Mankind, and call themselves <i>Ongue-honwe</i>; that is, Men surpassing all
others. This Opinion, which they take Care to cultivate into their
Children, gives them that Courage, which has been so terrible to all the
Nations of <i>North America</i>; and they have taken such Care to impress the
same Opinion of their People on all their Neighbours, that they, on all
Occasions, yield the most submissive Obedience to them. I have been told
by old Men in <i>New England</i>, who remembered the Time when the <i>Mohawks</i>
made War on their <i>Indians</i>, that as soon as a single <i>Mohawk</i> was
discover'd in the Country, their <i>Indians</i> raised a Cry from Hill to
Hill, <i>A Mohawk! A Mohawk!</i> upon which they all fled like Sheep before
Wolves, without attempting to make the least Resistance, whatever Odds
were on their Side. The poor <i>New England Indians</i> immediately ran to
the Christian Houses, and the <i>Mohawks</i> often pursued them so closely,
that they entered along with them, and knocked their Brains out in the
Presence of the People of the House; but if the Family had Time to shut
the Door, they never attempted to force it, and on no Occasion did any
Injury to the Christians. All the Nations round them have, for many
Years, intirely submitted to them, and pay a yearly Tribute to them in
<i>Wampum</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; they dare neither make War nor Peace, without the Consent
of the <i>Mohawks</i>. Two old Men commonly go about every Year or two, to
receive this Tribute; and I have often had Opportunity to observe what
Anxiety the poor <i>Indians</i> were under, while these two old Men remained
in that Part of the Country where I was. An old <i>Mohawk Sachem</i>, in a
poor Blanket and a dirty Shirt, may be seen issuing his Orders with as
arbitrary an Authority, as a <i>Roman</i> Dictator. It is not for the Sake of
Tribute however, that they make War, but from the Notions of Glory,
which they have ever most strongly imprinted on their Minds; and the
farther they go to seek an Enemy, the greater Glory they think they
gain; there cannot, I think, be a greater or stronger Instance than
this, how much the Sentiments, impressed upon a People's Mind, conduce
to their Grandeur, or one that more verifies a Saying often to be met
with, though but too little minded, That it is in the Power of the
Rulers of a People to make them either Great or Little; for by
inculcating only the Notions of Honour and Virtue, or those of Luxury
and Riches, the People, in a little Time, will become such as their
Rulers desire. The <i>Five Nations</i>, in their Love of Liberty, and of
their Country, in their Bravery in Battle, and their Constancy in
enduring Torments, equal the Fortitude of the most renowned <i>Romans</i>. I
shall finish their general Character by what an Enemy, a <i>Frenchman</i>,
says of them, <i>Monsieur De la Poterie</i>, in his History of <i>North
America</i>.</p>

<p>"When we speak (says he) of the <i>Five Nations</i> in <i>France</i>, they are
thought, by a common Mistake, to be mere Barbarians, always thirsting
after human Blood; but their true Character is very different. They are
indeed the fiercest and most formidable People in <i>North America</i>, and,
at the same Time, are as politick and judicious, as well can be
conceived; and this appears from the Management of all the Affairs which
they transact, not only with the <i>French</i> and <i>English</i>, but likewise
with almost all the <i>Indian</i> Nations of this vast Continent."</p>

<p>Their Matters of Consequence, which concern all the Nations, are
transacted in a general Meeting of the <i>Sachems</i> of each Nation. These
Conventions are commonly held at <i>Onnondaga</i>, which is nearly the Center
of their Country; but they have fixed on <i>Albany</i> for the Place of
treating with the <i>British Colonies</i>.</p>

<p>They strictly follow one Maxim, formerly used by the <i>Romans</i> to
increase their Strength, that is, they encourage the People of other
Nations to incorporate with them; and when they have subdued any People,
after they have satiated their Revenge by some cruel Examples, they
adopt the rest of their Captives; who, if they behave well, become
equally esteemed with their own People; so that some of their Captives
have afterwards become their greatest <i>Sachems</i> and <i>Captains</i>. The
<i>Tuskaroras</i>, after the War they had with the People of <i>Carolina</i>, fled
to the <i>Five Nations</i>, and are now incorporated with them; so that they
now properly indeed consist of six Nations, though they still retain the
old Name of the <i>Five Nations</i> among the <i>English</i>. The <i>Cowetas</i> also,
or <i>Creek-Indians</i>, are in the same Friendship with them.</p>

<p>The <i>Tuskaroras</i>, since they came under the Province of <i>New York</i>,
behave themselves well, and remain peaceable and quiet; and by this may
be seen the Advantage of using the <i>Indians</i> well, and I believe, if
they were still better used (as there is Room enough to do it) they
would be proportionably more useful to us.</p>

<p>The Cruelty the <i>Indians</i> use in their Wars, towards those that do not
or cannot resist, such as Women and Children, and to their Prisoners,
after they have them in their Power, is deservedly indeed held in
Abhorrence: But whoever reads the History of the so famed ancient
Heroes, will find them, I'm afraid, not much better in this Respect.
Does <i>Achilles</i>'s Behaviour to <i>Hector</i>'s dead Body, in <i>Homer</i>, appear
less savage? This Cruelty is also not peculiar to the <i>Five Nations</i>,
but equally practised by all other <i>Indians</i>. It is wonderful, how
Custom and Education are able to soften the most horrid Actions, even
among a polite and learned People; witness the <i>Carthaginians</i> and
<i>Phoenicians</i> burning their own Children alive in Sacrifice; and several
Passages in the <i>Jewish History</i>; and witness, in later Times, the
Christians burning one another alive, for God's Sake.</p>

<p>When any of the young Men of these Nations have a Mind to signalize
themselves, and to gain a Reputation among their Countrymen, by some
notable Enterprize against their Enemy, they at first communicate their
Design to two or three of their most intimate Friends; and if they come
into it, an Invitation is made, in their Names, to all the young Men of
the Castle, to feast on Dog's Flesh; but whether this be, because Dog's
Flesh is most agreeable to <i>Indian</i> Palates, or whether it be as an
Emblem of Fidelity, for which the Dog is distinguished by all Nations,
that it is always used on this Occasion, I have not sufficient
Information to determine. When the Company is met, the Promoters of the
Enterprize set forth the Undertaking in the best Colours they can; they
boast of what they intend to do, and incite others to join, from the
Glory there is to be obtained; and all who eat of the Dog's Flesh,
thereby inlist themselves.</p>

<p>The Night before they set out, they make a grand Feast, to this all the
noted Warriors of the Nation are invited; and here they have their War
Dance, to the Beat of a Kind of a Kettle-drum. The Warriors are seated
in two Rows in the House, and each rises up in his Turn, and sings the
great Acts he has himself performed, and the Deeds of his Ancestors;
and this is always accompanied with a Kind of a Dance, or rather
Action, representing the Manner in which they were performed; and from
Time to Time, all present join in a Chorus, applauding every notable
Act. They exaggerate the Injuries they have at any Time received from
their Enemies, and extol the Glory which any of their Ancestors have
gained by their Bravery and Courage; so that they work up their spirits
to a high Degree of warlike Enthusiasm. I have sometimes persuaded some
of their young <i>Indians</i> to act these Dances, for our Diversion, and to
shew us the Manner of them; and even, on these Occasions, they have
work'd themselves up to such a Pitch, that they have made all present
uneasy. Is it not probable, that such Designs as these have given the
first Rise to Tragedy?</p>

<p>They come to these Dances with their Faces painted in a frightful
Manner, as they always are when they go to War, to make themselves
terrible to their Enemies; and in this Manner the Night is spent. Next
Day they march out with much Formality, dressed in their finest Apparel,
and, in their March, observe a profound Silence. An Officer of the
regular Troops told me, that while he was Commandant of <i>Fort-Hunter</i>,
the <i>Mohawks</i>, on one of these Occasions, told him, that they expected
the usual military Honours as they passed the Garison. Accordingly he
drew out his Garison, the Men presented their Pieces as the <i>Indians</i>
passed, and the Drum beat a March; and with less Respect, the Officer
said, they would have been dissatisfied. The <i>Indians</i> passed in a
single Row, one after another, with great Gravity and profound Silence;
and every one of them, as he passed the Officer, took his Gun from his
Shoulder, and fired into the Ground near the Officer's Foot: They
marched in this Manner three or four Miles from their Castle. The Women,
on these Occasions, always follow them with their old Clothes, and they
send back by them their Finery in which they marched from the Castle.
But before they go from this Place, where they exchange their Clothes,
they always peel a large Piece of the Bark from some great Tree; they
commonly chuse an Oak, as most lasting; upon the smooth Side of this
Wood they, with their red Paint, draw one or more Canoes, going from
Home, with the Number of Men in them padling, which go upon the
Expedition; and some Animal, as a Deer or Fox, an Emblem of the Nation
against which the Expedition is designed, is painted at the Head of the
Canoes; for they always travel in Canoes along the Rivers, which lead to
the Country against which the Expedition is designed, as far as they
can.</p>

<p>After the Expedition is over, they stop at the same Place in their
Return, and send to their Castle, to inform their Friends of their
Arrival; that they may be prepared to give them a solemn Reception,
suited to the Success they have had. In the mean Time, they represent on
the same, or some Tree near it, the Event of the Enterprize, and now the
Canoes are painted with their Heads turned towards the Castle; the
Number of the Enemy killed, is represented by Scalps painted black, and
the Number of Prisoners by as many Withs, (in their Painting not unlike
Pothooks) with which they usually pinion their Captives. These Trees are
the Annals, or rather Trophies of the <i>Five Nations</i>: I have seen many
of them; and by them, and their War Songs, they preserve the History of
their great Achievements. The solemn Reception of these Warriors, and
the Acclamations of Applause, which they receive at their Return, cannot
but have in the Hearers the same Effect, in raising an Emulation for
Glory, that a Triumph had on the old <i>Romans</i>.</p>

<p>After their Prisoners are secured, they never offer them the least
Male-treatment, but, on the contrary, will rather starve themselves,
than suffer them to want; and I have been always assured, that there is
not one Instance, of their offering the least Violence to the Chastity
of any Woman that was their Captive. But notwithstanding this, the poor
Prisoners afterwards undergo severe Punishments before they receive the
last Doom of Life or Death. The Warriors think it for their Glory, to
lead them through all the Villages of the Nations subject to them, which
lie near the Road; and these, to shew their Affection to the <i>Five
Nations</i>, and their Abhorrence of their Enemies, draw up in two Lines,
through which the poor Prisoners, stark naked, must run the Gauntlet;
and on this Occasion, it is always observed, the Women are much more
cruel than the Men. The Prisoners meet with the same sad Reception when
they reach their Journey's End; and after this, they are presented to
those that have lost any Relation in that or any former Enterprize. If
the Captives be accepted, there is an End to their Sorrow from that
Moment; they are dressed as fine as they can make them; they are
absolutely free (except to return to their own Country) and enjoy all
the Privileges the Person had, in whose Place they are accepted; but if
otherwise they die in Torments, to satiate the Revenge of those that
refuse them.</p>

<p>If a young Man or Boy be received in Place of a Husband that was killed,
all the Children of the Deceased call that Boy Father; so that one may
sometimes hear a Man of thirty say, that such a Boy of fifteen or twenty
is his Father.</p>

<p>Their Castles are generally a Square surrounded with Palisadoes, without
any Bastions or Out-works; for, since the general Peace, their Villages
lie all open.</p>

<p>Their only Instruments of War are Musquets, Hatchets, and long sharp
pointed Knives; these they always carry about with them: Their Hatchet,
in War-time, is stuck in their Girdle behind them; and besides what Use
they make of this Weapon in their Hand, they have a dexterous Way of
throwing it, which I have seen them often practise in their Exercise,
by throwing it into a Tree at a Distance: They have, in this, the Art of
directing and regulating the Motion, so that though the Hatchet turns
round as it flies, the Edge always sticks in the Tree, and near the
Place at which they aim it. The Use of Bows and Arrows are now intirely
laid aside, except among the Boys, who are still very dexterous in
killing Fowls and other Animals with them.</p>

<p>They use neither Drum nor
Trumpet, nor any Kind of musical Instrument in their Wars; their Throats
serve them on all Occasions, where such are necessary. Many of them have
a surprising Faculty of raising their Voice, not only in inarticulate
Sounds, but likewise to make their Words understood at a great Distance;
and we find the same was practised by <i>Homer</i>'s Heroes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Thrice to its Pitch his lofty Voice he rears,&mdash;&mdash;</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O Friend!</i> Ulysses <i>Shouts invade my Ears.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> have such absolute Notions of Liberty, that they
allow of no Kind of Superiority of one over another, and banish all
Servitude from their Territories. They never make any Prisoner a Slave;
but it is customary among them to make a Compliment of Naturalization
into the <i>Five Nations</i>; and, considering how highly they value
themselves above all others, this must be no small Compliment. This is
not done by any general Act of the Nation, but every single Person has a
Right to do it, by a Kind of Adoption. The first Time I was among the
<i>Mohawks</i>, I had this Compliment from one of their old <i>Sachems</i>, which
he did, by giving me his own Name, <i>Cayenderongue</i>. He had been a
notable Warrior; and he told me, that now I had a Right to assume to
myself all the Acts of Valour he had performed, and that now my Name
would echo from Hill to Hill all over the <i>Five Nations</i>. As for my
Part, I thought no more of it at that Time, than as an Artifice to draw
a Belly full of strong Liquor from me, for himself and his Companions;
but when about ten or twelve Years afterwards, my Business led me again
among them, I directed the Interpreter to say something from me to the
<i>Sachems</i>; he was for some Time at a Loss to understand their Answer,
till he had asked me whether I had any Name among them: I then found
that I was really known to them by that Name, and that the old <i>Sachem</i>,
from the Time he had given me his Name, had assumed another to himself.
I was adopted, at that Time, into the Tribe of the <i>Bear</i>, and, for that
Reason, I often afterwards had the kind Compliment of <i>Brother Bear</i>.</p>

<p>The Hospitality of these <i>Indians</i> is no less remarkable, than their
other Virtues; as soon as any Stranger comes, they are sure to offer him
Victuals. If there be several in Company, and come from a-far, one of
their best Houses is cleaned and given up for their Entertainment. Their
Complaisance, on these Occasions, goes even farther than Christian
Civility allows of, as they have no other Rule for it, than the
furnishing their Guest with every Thing they think will be agreeable to
him; for this Reason, some of their prettiest Girls are always ordered
to wash themselves, and dress in their best Apparel, in Order to be
presented to the Stranger, for his Choice; and the young Lady, who has
the Honour to be preferred on these Occasions, performs all the Duties
of a fond Wife, during the Stranger's Stay: But this last Piece of
Hospitality is now either laid aside by the <i>Mohawks</i>, or, at least,
they never offer it to any Christian. This Nation indeed has laid aside
many of its ancient Customs, and so likewise have the other Nations,
with whom we are best acquainted; and have adopted many of ours; so that
it is not easy now to distinguish their original and genuine Manners,
from those which they have lately acquired; and for this Reason it is,
that they now seldom offer Victuals to Persons of any Distinction,
because they know, that their Food and Cookery is not agreeable to our
delicate Palates. Their Men value themselves, in having all Kind of Food
in equal Esteem. A <i>Mohawk Sachem</i> told me with a Kind of Pride, That a
Man eats every Thing without Distinction, <i>Bears, Cats, Dogs, Snakes,
Frogs</i>, &amp;c. intimating, that it is Womanish, to have any Delicacy in the
Choice of Food.</p>

<p>I can however give two strong Instances of the Hospitality of the
<i>Mohawks</i>, which fell under my own Observation; and which shew, that
they have the very same Notion of Hospitality, which we find in the
ancient Poets. When I was last in the <i>Mohawks</i> Country, the <i>Sachems</i>
told me, that they had an <i>Englishman</i> among their People, a Servant who
had run from his Master in <i>New York</i>. I immediately told them, that
they must deliver him up. No, they answered, we never serve any Man so,
who puts himself under our Protection. On this I insisted on the Injury
they did thereby to his Master; and they allowed it might be an Injury,
and replied, though we never will deliver him up, we are willing to pay
the Value of the Servant to the Master. Another Man made his Escape from
the Goal of <i>Albany</i>, where he was in Prison on an Execution for Debt;
the <i>Mohawks</i> received him, and, as they protected him against the
Sheriff and his Officers, they not only paid the Debt for him, but gave
him Land, over and above sufficient for a good Farm, whereon he lived
when I was last there. To this it may be added, all their extraordinary
Visits are accompanied with giving and receiving Presents of some Value;
as we learn likewise from <i>Homer</i> was the Practice in old Times.</p>

<p><i>Polygamy</i> is not usual among them; and indeed, in any Nation, where all
are on a Par, as to Riches and Power, Plurality of Wives cannot well be
introduced. As all Kind of Slavery is banished from the Countries of the
<i>Five Nations</i>, so they keep themselves free also from the Bondage of
Wedlock; and when either of the Parties becomes disgusted, they separate
without Formality or Ignominy to either, unless it be occasioned by some
scandalous Offence in one of them. And in Case of Divorce, the Children,
according to the natural Course of all Animals, follow the Mother. The
Women here bring forth their Children with as much Ease as other
Animals, and without the Help of a Midwife, and, soon after their
Delivery, return to their usual Employment. They alone also perform all
the Drudgery about their Houses, they plant their Corn, and labour it,
in every Respect, till it is brought to the Table: They likewise cut all
their Fire-wood, and bring it Home on their Backs, and in their Marches
bear the Burdens. The Men disdain all Kind of Labour, and employ
themselves alone in Hunting, as the only proper Business for Soldiers.
At Times, when it is not proper to hunt, one finds the <i>old Men</i> in
Companies, in Conversation; the young Men at their Exercises, shooting
at Marks, throwing the Hatchet, Wrestling, or Running, and the Women all
busy at Labour in the Fields.</p>

<p>On these Occasions, the State of <i>Laced&aelig;mon</i> ever occurs to my Mind,
which that of the <i>Five Nations</i>, in many Respects, resembles; their
Laws, or Customs, being, in both, form'd to render the Minds and Bodies
of the People fit for War.</p>

<p>Theft is very scandalous among them; and it is necessary it should be so
among all <i>Indians</i>, since they have no Locks, but those of their Minds,
to preserve their Goods.</p>

<p>There is one Vice which the <i>Indians</i> have all fallen into, since their
Acquaintance with the <i>Christians</i>, and of which they could not be
guilty before that Time, that is, Drunkenness: It is strange, how all
the <i>Indian</i> Nations, and almost every Person among them, Male and
Female, are infatuated with the Love of strong Drink; they know no
Bounds to their Desire, while they can swallow it down, and then indeed
the greatest Man among them scarcely deserves the Name of a Brute.</p>

<p>They never have been taught to conquer any Passion, but by some contrary
Passion; and the Traders, with whom they chiefly converse, are so far
from giving them any Abhorrence of this Vice, that they encourage it all
they can, not only for the Profit of the Liquor they sell, but that they
may have an Opportunity to impose upon them. And this, as they chiefly
drink Spirits, has destroyed greater Numbers, than all their Wars and
Diseases put together.</p>

<p>The People of the <i>Five Nations</i> are much given to <i>Speech-making</i>, ever
the natural Consequence of a perfect Republican Government: Where no
single Person has a Power to compel, the Arts of Persuasion alone must
prevail. As their best Speakers distinguish themselves in their publick
Councils and Treaties with other Nations, and thereby gain the Esteem
and Applause of their Countrymen, (the only Superiority which any one of
them has over the others) it is probable they apply themselves to this
Art, by some Kind of Study and Exercise, in a great Measure. It is
impossible for me to judge how far they excel, as I am ignorant of their
Language; but the Speakers whom I have heard, had all a great Fluency of
Words, and much more Grace in their Manner, than any Man could expect,
among a People intirely ignorant of all the liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>I am inform'd, that they are very nice in the Turn of their Expressions,
and that few of themselves are so far Masters of their Language, as
never to offend the Ears of their <i>Indian</i> Auditory, by an unpolite
Expression. They have, it seems, a certain <i>Urbanitas</i>, or <i>Atticism</i>,
in their Language, of which the common Ears are ever sensible, though
only their great Speakers attain to it. They are so much given to
Speech-making, that their common Complements, to any Person they
respect, at meeting and parting, are made in Harangues.</p>

<p>They have some Kind of Elegancy in varying and compounding their Words,
to which, not many of themselves attain, and this principally
distinguishes their best Speakers. I have endeavoured to get some
Account of this, as a Thing that might be acceptable to the Curious;
but, as I have not met with any one Person who understands their
Language, and also knows any Thing of Grammar, or of the learned
Languages, I have not been able to attain the least Satisfaction. Their
present Minister tells me, that their Verbs are varied, but in a Manner
so different from the <i>Greek</i> or <i>Latin</i>, that he cannot discover by
what Rule it was done; and even suspects, that every Verb has a peculiar
Mode: They have but few radical Words, but they compound their Words
without End; by this their Language becomes sufficiently copious, and
leaves Room for a good Deal of Art to please a delicate Ear. Sometimes
one Word among them includes an entire Definition of the Thing; for
Example, they call <i>Wine Oneharadeseboengtseragberie</i>, as much as to
say, a <i>Liquor made of the Juice of the Grape</i>. The Words expressing
Things lately come to their Knowledge are all Compounds: They have no
Labeals in their Language, nor can they pronounce perfectly any Word
wherein there is a Labeal; and when one endeavours to teach them to
pronounce these Words, they tell one, they think it ridiculous that they
must shut their Lips to speak. Their Language abounds with Gutturals and
strong Aspirations, these make it very sonorous and bold; and their
Speeches abound with Metaphors, after the Manner of the Eastern Nations,
as will best appear by the Speeches that I have copied.</p>

<p>As to what <i>religious Notions</i> they have, it is difficult to judge of
them; because the <i>Indians</i>, that speak any <i>English</i>, and live near us,
have learned many Things of us; and it is not easy to distinguish the
Notions they had originally among themselves, from those they have
learned of the <i>Christians</i>. It is certain they have no Kind of publick
Worship, and I am told that they have no radical Word to express <i>God</i>,
but use a compound Word, signifying the Preserver, Sustainer, or Master
of the Universe; neither could I ever learn what Sentiments they have of
a future Existence. Their funeral Rites seem to be formed upon a Notion
of some Kind of Existence after Death: They make a large round Hole, in
which the Body can be placed upright, or upon its Haunches, which after
the Body is placed in it, is covered with Timber, to support the Earth
which they lay over, and thereby keep the Body free from being pressed;
they then raise the Earth in a round Hill over it. They always dress the
Corps in all its Finery, and put Wampum and other Things into the Grave
with it; and the Relations suffer not Grass or any Weed to grow on the
Grave, and frequently visit it with Lamentations: But whether these
Things be done only as Marks of Respect to the Deceased, or from a
Notion of some Kind of Existence after Death, must be left to the
Judgment of the Reader.</p>

<p>They are very superstitious in observing Omens and Dreams; I have
observed them shew a superstitious Awe of the Owl, and be highly
displeased with some that mimicked the Cry of that Bird in the Night. An
Officer of the regular Troops has informed me also, that while he had
the Command of the Garrison at <i>Oswego</i>, a Boy of one of the far
Westward Nations died there; the Parents made a regular Pile of split
Wood, laid the Corps upon it, and burnt it; while the Pile was burning,
they stood gravely looking on, without any Lamentation, but when it was
burnt down, they gathered up the Bones with many Tears, put them into a
Box, and carried them away with them; and this Inclination, which all
ignorant People have to Superstition and amusing Ceremonies, gives the
Popish Priests a great Advantage in recommending their Religion, beyond
what the Regularity of the Protestant Doctrine allows of.</p>

<p>Queen <i>Anne</i> sent over a Missionary to reside among the <i>Mohawks</i>, and
allowed him a sufficient Subsistence from the privy Purse; she sent
Furniture for a Chappel, and a valuable set of Plate for the Communion
Table; and (if I am not mistaken) the like Furniture and Plate for each
of the other Nations, though that of the <i>Mohawks</i> was only applied to
the Use designed. The common Prayer, or at least a considerable Part of
it, was translated also into their Language and printed; some other
Pieces were likewise translated for the Minister's Use, <i>viz</i>. An
Exposition of the Creed, Decalogue, Lord's Prayer, and Church Catechism,
and a Discourse on the Sacraments. But as that Minister was never able
to attain any tolerable Knowledge of their Language, and was naturally a
heavy Man, he had but small Success; and his Allowance failing, by the
Queen's Death, he left them. These Nations had no Teacher, from that
Time, till within these few Years, that a young Gentleman, out of pious
Zeal, went voluntarily among the <i>Mohawks</i>. He was at first intirely
ignorant of their Language, and had no Interpreter, except one of the
<i>Indians</i>, who understood a little <i>English</i>, and had, in the late
Missionary's Time, learn'd to read and write in his own Language. He
learned from him how to pronounce the Words in the Translations, which
had been made for the late Missionary's Use. He set up a School, to
teach their Children to read and write their own Language; and they made
surprizing Proficiency, considering their Master did not understand
their Language. I happened to be in the <i>Mohawk</i> Country, and saw
several of their Performances; I was present at their Worship, where
they went through some Part of the Common Prayer with great Decency. I
was likewise present, several Times, at their private Devotions, which
some of them performed duly, Morning and Evening. I had also many
Opportunities of observing the great Regard they had for this young Man;
so far, that the Fear of his leaving them made the greatest Restraint on
them, with which he threatened them, after they had been guilty of any
Offence. Soon after that Time, this Gentleman went to <i>England</i>,
received Orders, and was sent by the Society, Missionary to <i>Albany</i>,
with Liberty to spend some Part of his Time among the <i>Mohawks</i>.</p>

<p>I had lately a Letter from him, dated the seventh of <i>December</i>, 1641,
in which he writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Drunkenness was so common among them, that I doubt, whether
there was one grown Person of either Sex free from it; seldom a
Day passed, without some, and very often forty or fifty being
drunk at a Time. But I found they were very fond of keeping me
among them, and afraid I should leave them, which I made Use of
to good Purpose; daily threatning them with my Departure, in
Case they did not forsake that Vice, and frequently requiring a
particular Promise from them singly; by which Means (through
God's Blessing) there was a gradual Reformation; and I know not
that I have seen above ten or twelve Persons drunk among them
this Summer. The Women are almost all entirely reformed, and the
Men very much. They have intirely left off Divorces, and are
legally married. They are very constant and devout at church and
Family Devotions. They have not been known to exercise Cruelty
to Prisoners, and have, in a great Measure, left off going a
fighting, which I find the most difficult, of all Things, to
dissuade them from. They seem also persuaded of the Truths of
Christianity. The greatest Inconveniency I labour under, is the
Want of an Interpreter, which could I obtain, for two or three
Years, I should hope to be tolerably Master of their Language,
and be able to render it easier to my Successor."</p></div>

<p>This Gentleman's uncommon Zeal deserves, I think, this publick
Testimony, that it may be a Means of his receiving such Encouragement,
as may enable him to pursue the pious Purposes he has in View.</p>

<p>The <i>Mohawks</i>, were they civilized, may be useful to us many Ways, and,
on many Occasions, more than any of our own People can be; and this well
deserves to be considered.</p>

<p>There is one Custom their Men constantly observe, which I must not
forget to mention; That if they be sent with any Message, though it
demand the greatest Dispatch, or though they bring Intelligence of any
imminent Danger, they never tell it at their first Approach; but sit
down for a Minute or two, at least, in Silence, to recollect themselves,
before they speak, that they may not shew any Degree of Fear or
Surprize, by an indecent Expression. Every sudden Repartee, in a publick
Treaty, leaves with them an Impression of a light inconsiderate Mind;
but, in private Conversation, they use, and are delighted with brisk
witty Answers, as we can be. By this they shew the great Difference they
place between the Conversations of Man and Man, and of Nation and
Nation; and in this, and a thousand other Things, might well be an
Example to the <i>European</i> Nations.</p>

<h2>CHAP. I.</h2>

<h4><i>Of the Wars of the</i> Five Nations <i>with the</i> Adirondacks <i>and</i>
Quatoghies.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he first Settlers of <i>New-York</i> having been little curious in inquiring
into the <i>Indian Affairs</i>, further than what related to Trade; or, at
least, having neglected to transmit their Discoveries to Posterity, it
is much more difficult to give a just History of these Nations before,
than since the Time of their being under the <i>Crown of England</i>. What we
can learn of Certainty, however, is this. The <i>French</i> settled at
<i>Canada</i> in the Year 1603, six Years before the <i>Dutch</i> possessed
themselves of <i>New-Netherlands</i>, now called <i>New-York</i>, and found the
<i>Five Nations</i> at War with the <i>Adirondacks</i>, which, they tell us, was
occasioned in the following Manner.</p>

<p>The <i>Adirondacks</i> formerly lived three-hundred Miles above <i>Trois
Rivieres</i>, where now the <i>Utawawas</i> are situated; at that Time they
employ'd themselves wholly in Hunting, and the <i>Five Nations</i> made
planting of Corn their Business. By this Means they became useful to
each other, by exchanging Corn for Venison. The <i>Adirondacks</i>, however,
valued themselves, as delighting in a more manly Employment, and
despised the <i>Five Nations</i>, in following Business, which they thought
only fit for Women. But it once happened, that the Game failed the
<i>Adirondacks</i>, which made them desire some of the young Men of the <i>Five
Nations</i> to assist them in Hunting. These young Men soon became much
more expert in Hunting, and able to endure Fatigues, than the
<i>Adirondacks</i> expected or desired; in short, they became jealous of
them, and, one Night, murdered all the young Men they had with them. The
<i>Five Nations</i> complained to the Chiefs of the <i>Adirondacks</i>, of the
Inhumanity of this Action; but they contented themselves with blaming
the Murderers, and ordered them to make some small<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Presents to the
Relations of the murdered Persons, without being apprehensive of the
Resentment of the <i>Five Nations</i>; for they looked upon them, as Men not
capable of taking any great Revenge.</p>

<p>This however provoked the <i>Five Nations</i> to that Degree, that they soon
resolved, by some Means, to be revenged; and the <i>Adirondacks</i> being
informed of their Designs, thought to prevent them, by reducing them
with Force to their Obedience.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> then lived near where <i>Mont Real</i> now stands; they
defended themselves at first but faintly against the vigorous Attacks of
the <i>Adirondacks</i>, and were forced to leave their own Country, and fly
to the Banks of the Lakes where they live now. As they were hitherto
Losers by the War, it obliged them to apply themselves to the Exercise
of Arms, in which they became daily more and more expert. Their
<i>Sachems</i>, in order to raise their People's Spirits, turned them against
the <i>Satanas</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, a less warlike Nation, who then lived on the Banks of
the Lakes; for they found it was difficult to remove the Dread their
People had of the Valour of the <i>Adirondacks</i>. The <i>Five Nations</i> soon
subdued the <i>Satanas</i>, and drove them out of their Country; and their
People's Courage being thus elevated, they, from this Time, not only
defended themselves bravely against the whole Force of the
<i>Adirondacks</i>, but often carried the War into the Heart of the
<i>Adirondacks</i>'s Country, and, at last, forced them to leave it, and to
fly into that Part of the Country, where <i>Quebeck</i> is now built.</p>

<p>There are more Instances than one in History, of poor dispirited
Nations, that by some signal Affront or Abuse have had their Spirits so
raised, that they have not only performed notable Things on a sudden,
but, if they happened, at the same Time, to be led and governed by wise
Men, have so far kept up, and improved that Spirit, that they have
become, in a Manner, a different People. Let us examine History, and we
shall find, that the different Figure every Country has made in the
World, has been ever principally owing to the Principles which were
inculcated into, and carefully cultivated in the People. In this chiefly
consists the Art of making a Nation glorious, or the Crime of debasing
them into Servitude or Slavery. It was from the Notions of Liberty,
Honour, and Glory, and such wise and generous Principles, which the
meanest Citizen among the old <i>Romans</i> entertained, that they became so
great and powerful, and a Terror to all Nations; as the sordid,
timorous, cunning Artifices, and the Love of Wealth and sensual
Pleasures, cultivated among the present <i>Romans</i>, has debased them now
into the meanest and least feared Nation on the Earth. The History of
the <i>Five Nations</i> will readily shew, how far the ancient <i>Roman</i>
Principles have been cultivated among them.</p>

<p>Soon after this Change of the People of these Nations, the <i>French</i>
arrived at <i>Canada</i>, and settled at <i>Quebeck</i>; and they thinking it
adviseable to gain the Esteem and Friendship of the <i>Adirondacks</i>, in
whose Country they settled, <i>Monsieur Champlain</i>, the first Governor of
<i>Canada</i>, joined the <i>Adirondacks</i> in an Expedition against the <i>Five
Nations</i>. They met a Party of two-hundred Men of the <i>Five Nations</i> in
<i>Corlar's Lake</i>, which the <i>French</i>, on this Occasion called by
<i>Monsieur Champlain's</i> Name, and both Sides went ashore to prepare for
Battle, which proved to the Disadvantage of the <i>Five Nations</i>. The
<i>French</i>, in short, kept themselves undiscover'd, till the Moment they
began to join Battle; and their Fire-arms surprised the <i>Five Nations</i>
so much, that they were immediately put into Confusion; for, before that
Time, they had never seen such Weapons. The Trade with the <i>French</i>,
soon after this, drew most of the neighbouring Nations to <i>Quebeck</i>, and
they all joined in the War against the <i>Five Nations</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Adirondacks</i> having their Numbers thus increased, and their
Fire-arms giving them new Confidence, proposed nothing less to
themselves, than the intire Destruction of the <i>Five Nations</i>. Upon
this, their young Warriors became fierce and insolent, and would not be
kept under any Discipline or Subjection to their Captains; but, upon all
Occasions, rashly attacked the Enemy, who were obliged to keep
themselves upon the defensive; and to make up what they wanted in Force,
by Stratagems, and a skilful Management of the War. The young Men of the
<i>Five Nations</i> soon perceived the Advantages they gained by this
Conduct, and every Day grew more submissive to their Captains, and
diligent in executing any Enterprize.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> sent out small Parties only, who meeting with great
Numbers of the <i>Adirondacks</i>, retired before them with seeming Terror,
while the <i>Adirondacks</i> pursued them with Fury, and without Thought,
till they were cunningly drawn into Ambuscades, where most of their Men
were killed or taken Prisoners, with little or no Loss to the <i>Five
Nations</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Adirondacks</i>, by this Means, wasted away, and their boldest
Soldiers were almost intirely destroy'd, while the Number of the <i>Five
Nations</i> were increased, by the Addition of the Prisoners, which they
took from the <i>Satanas</i>.</p>

<p>The wisest and best Soldiers of the <i>Adirondacks</i>, when it was too late,
now at length discovered, that they must learn the Art of War from those
Enemies that they at first despised; and now five of their Captains
endeavoured to perform by themselves singly, with Art and by Stratagem,
what they could not do by Force at the Head of their Armies; they had
however no longer any Hopes of conquering, their Thoughts were only set
on Revenge.</p>

<p>It is not improper to observe here, once for all, that in writing the
History of <i>Indians</i>, it is often necessary to give an Account of the
Enterprizes of single Persons, otherwise the <i>Indian</i> Genius can never
be known, or their Manner of making War understood. An <i>Indian</i> named
<i>Piskaret</i> was at this Time one of the Captains of greatest Fame among
the <i>Adirondacks:</i> This bold Man, with four other Captains, set out for
<i>Trois-Rivieres</i> in one Canoe, each of them being provided with three
Musquets, which they loaded with two Bullets apiece, joined with a small
Chain ten Inches long; they met with five Canoes in <i>Sorel River</i>, each
having ten Men of the <i>Five Nations</i> on Board. <i>Piskaret</i> and his
Captains, as soon as those of the <i>Five Nations</i> drew near, pretended to
give themselves up for lost, and sung their Death Song,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> then suddenly
fired upon the Canoes, which they repeated with the Arms that lay ready
loaded, and tore those Birch Vessels betwixt Wind and Water. The Men of
the <i>Five Nations</i> were so surprized, that they tumbled out of their
Canoes, and gave <i>Piskaret</i> and his Companions the Opportunity of
knocking as many of them on the Head as they pleased, and saving the
others, to feed their Revenge, which they did, by burning them alive
with the most cruel Torments. This however was so far from glutting
<i>Piskaret</i>'s Revenge, that it seemed rather to give a keener Edge to it;
for he soon after undertook another Enterprize, in which none of his
Countrymen durst accompany him: He was well acquainted with the Country
of the <i>Five Nations</i>, and set out about the Time the Snow began to
melt, with the Precaution of putting the hinder Part of his Snow Shoes
forward, that if any should happen upon his Footsteps, they might think
he was gone the contrary Way; and, for further Security, went along the
Ridges and high Grounds, where the Snow was melted, that his Track
might be often lost; when he came near one of the Villages of the <i>Five
Nations</i>, he hid himself till Night, and then entered a Cabin, while
every Body was fast asleep, murdered the whole Family, and carried their
Scalps into his lurking Place. The next day the People of the Village
searched for the Murderer in vain. The following Night he murdered all
he found in another Cabin. The Inhabitants next Day searched likewise in
vain for the Murderer; but the third Night a Watch was kept in every
House. <i>Piskaret</i> in the Night bundled up the Scalps he had taken the
two former Nights, to carry, as the Proof of his Victory, and then stole
privately from House to House, till at last he found an <i>Indian</i>
nodding, who was upon the Watch in one of the Houses; he knockt this
Man on the Head; but as this alarmed the rest, he was forced immediately
to fly. He was however under no great Concern from the Pursuit, being
more swift of Foot than any <i>Indian</i> then living. He let his Pursuers
come near him from Time to Time, and then would dart from them. This he
did with Design to tire them out with the Hopes of overtaking Him. As it
began to grow dark, he hid himself, and his Pursuers stop'd to rest.
They not being apprehensive of any Danger from a single Man, soon fell
asleep, and the bold <i>Piskaret</i> observing this, knock'd them all on the
Head, and carried away their Scalps with the rest. Such Stories as these
are told among the <i>Indians</i>, as extraordinary Instances of the Courage
and Conduct of their Captains. The <i>Indians</i> will often travel thus
three or four Hundred Miles singly, or two or three in Company, and lurk
about their Enemy's Borders for several Weeks, in Hopes to revenge the
Death of a near Relation or dear Friend. Indeed they give themselves so
very much up to Revenge, that this Passion seems to gnaw their Souls,
and gives them no Rest till they satisfy it. It is this Delight in
Revenge, that makes all barbarous Nations cruel; and the curbing such
Passions is one of the happy Effects of being civilized.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> are so much delighted with Stratagems in War, that no
Superiority of their Forces ever make them neglect them. They amused the
<i>Adirondacks</i> and their Allies the <i>Quatoghies</i> (called by the <i>French
Hurons</i>) by sending to the <i>French</i>, and desiring Peace. The <i>French</i>
desired them to receive some Priests among them, in Hopes that those
prudent Fathers would, by some Art, reconcile them to their Interest,
and engage their Affections. The <i>Five Nations</i> readily accepted the
Offer, and some <i>Jesuits</i> went along with them: But after they had the
Jesuits in their Power, they used them only as Hostages, and thereby
obliged the <i>French</i> to stand neuter, while they prepared to attack the
<i>Adirondacks</i> and <i>Quatoghies</i>, and they defeated the <i>Quatoghies</i> in a
dreadful Battle fought within two Leagues of <i>Quebeck</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> own, That if the <i>Five Nations</i> had known their Weakness at
that Time, they might have easily destroyed the whole Colony.</p>

<p>This Defeat, in Sight of the <i>French</i> Settlements, struck Terror into
all their Allies, who were at that Time very numerous, because of the
Trade with the <i>French</i>, which furnished them with many the most useful
Conveniences; for before that Time the <i>Indians</i> had no Iron Tool among
them.</p>

<p>The <i>Nipeceriniens</i>, who then lived on the Banks of <i>St. Laurence
River</i>, fled upon this to the Northward, believing that the extreme
Coldness of the Climate, and a barren Soil, would be the securest
Defence against the Ambition of the <i>Five Nations</i>. The Remainder of the
<i>Quatoghies</i> fled with the <i>Utawawas</i> Southwestward; and for the greater
Security, settled in an Island, which being further than the Name of the
<i>Five Nations</i> had then reached, they trusted to the Distance of the
Place, and the Advantage of its Situation.</p>

<p>Their last Expedition having succeeded so well, the <i>Five Nations</i> gave
out, that they intended next Winter to visit <i>Yonnendio</i>, (the Name they
give to the Governor of <i>Canada</i>;) these Visits are always made with
much Shew. Under this Pretence they gathered together 1000 or 1200 Men.
Their out Scouts met with <i>Piskaret</i> near <i>Niccolet River</i>, and still
pretending a friendly Visit to the Governor of <i>Canada</i>, as their only
Design, he told them, that the <i>Adirondacks</i> were divided into two
Bodies, one of which hunted on the North Side of <i>St. Laurence River</i> at
<i>Wabmake</i>, three Leagues above <i>Trois Rivieres</i>, and the other at
<i>Nicolet</i>. As soon as they had gained this Information, they killed him,
and returned with his Head to the Army. The <i>Five Nations</i> divided
likewise into two Bodies; they surprized the <i>Adirondacks</i> in both
Places, and in both cut them in pieces.</p>

<p>Thus the most warlike and polite Nation of all the <i>Indians</i> in <i>North
America</i>, was almost intirely destroyed by a People they at first
despised, and by a War which their Pride and Injustice brought upon
them; and we here see, that all the Advantages of Numbers, Courage and
Weapons, is not equal to good discipline in an Army.</p>

<p>A very few <i>Adirondacks</i> only now remain in some Villages near
<i>Quebeck</i>, who still waste away and decay, by their drinking strong
Waters, tho' when the <i>French</i> first settled at <i>Quebeck</i>, 1500 fighting
Men of them lived between that Place and <i>Sillerie</i>, which are only a
League distant, besides those that lived at <i>Saquenay, Trois Rivieres</i>,
and some other Places. And since this decisive Battle, the <i>Adirondacks</i>
have never been considered as of any Consequence, either in Peace or
War.</p>

<p>The <i>Quatoghies</i> and <i>Atawawas</i> now soon began to be in Want of the
<i>European</i> Commodities, which had made them considerable among their
new Friends. In order therefore to supply themselves anew, they
returned to Trade at <i>Quebeck</i>; and by this Means the Place of their
Retreat was discovered to the <i>five Nations</i>; and they not having their
Revenge satiated, while the <i>Quatoghies</i> had a Being, soon convinced
them, that no Extent of Country could set bounds to that Passion, when
it rages in the Hearts of the <i>Five Nations</i>, for they soon after
attack'd them in their new Settlement. The <i>Quatoghies</i> had the good
Fortune to discover the <i>Five Nations</i> Time enough to make their Escape,
and fled to the <i>Putewatemies</i>, who lived a Day's Journey further, where
they, and all the Neighbouring Nations, secured themselves in a large
Fort. The <i>Five Nations</i> followed, but, being in Want of Provision, they
could not attempt a Siege, and therefore proposed a Treaty with the
<i>Putewatemies</i>, which was accepted. The <i>Putewatemies</i> acknowledged the
<i>Five Nations</i> as Masters of all the Nations round them, applauded their
Valour, and promised them their Friendship, and to supply them with
Provisions; they would not however trust themselves out of their Fort,
but sent out a Supply; and even this they did, only with Design to do
that by Treachery, which they durst not attempt by Force; for the
Provisions were poisoned. The Treachery was discovered however to the
<i>Five Nations</i>, by an old <i>Quatoghie</i>, who had a Son Prisoner among
them; his Affection for his Son overcoming even his Hatred to his
Country's Enemies. This Treachery highly enraged the <i>Five Nations</i>
against the <i>Putewatemies</i>, and the neighbouring People; but Famine
obliging them to retire at this Time, they divided their Armies into
Parties, the better to provide for their Subsistence, by Hunting; one of
these Parties in their Chace fell in with a Village of the
<i>Chicktaghicks</i> (called by the <i>French Hinois</i>) and surprized the old
Men, Women and Children, when the young Men were abroad hunting; but
the young Men, upon their Return, gathering together all the rest of the
Villages, pursued this Party of the <i>Five Nations</i>, and recovered the
Prisoners.</p>

<p>This was the first Time that the <i>Five Nations</i> had been seen in those
Parts, but their Name was become so terrible, that the <i>Chictaghicks</i>,
notwithstanding this Advantage, left their Country, and fled to the
Nations that lived westward, till the General Peace was settled by the
<i>French</i>, and not till on that Occasion returned to their own Country.</p>

<h4><i>The Wars and Treaties of Peace of the</i> Indians <i>of the</i> Five Nations
<i>with the</i> French, <i>from</i> 1665 <i>to</i> 1683, <i>and their Affairs with</i>
New-York <i>in that Time</i>.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n <i>June</i> 1665 <i>Monsieur De Trasi</i> appointed <i>Vice-Roy</i> of <i>America</i> by
the <i>French King</i>, arrived at <i>Quebeck</i>, after he had visited the
<i>French Islands</i> in the <i>West Indies</i>, and brought with him four
Companies of Foot; and in <i>September</i> of the same Year, <i>Mr. Coursel</i>
arrived Governor General of <i>Canada</i>; he brought with him a Regiment and
several Families, with all Things necessary for establishing of a
Colony. Their Force being now thus considerably augmented, the <i>French</i>
Governor resolved to chastise the Insolence of the <i>Five Nations</i>; and
for that Purpose, in the Winter, sent out a Party against the <i>Mohawks</i>,
but these by the Cold, and their not knowing the Use of Snow Shoes,
suffered very much, without doing any Thing against the Enemy.</p>

<p>This Party however fell in with <i>Skenectady</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, a small Town which
<i>Corlear</i> (a considerable Man among the <i>Dutch</i>) had then newly settled.
When they appeared near <i>Shenectady</i>, they were almost dead with Cold
and Hunger; and the <i>Indians</i>, who were then in that Village, had
intirely destroyed them, if <i>Corlear</i>, (in Compassion to his fellow
Christians) had not contriv'd their Escape. He had a mighty Influence
over the <i>Indians</i>; and it is from him, and in Remembrance of his Merit,
that all Governors of <i>New-York</i> are called <i>Corlear</i> by the <i>Indians</i>
to this Day, tho' he himself was never Governor. He persuaded the
<i>Indians</i>, that this was a small Party of the <i>French</i> Army come to
amuse them, that the great Body was gone directly towards their Castles,
and that it was necessary for them immediately to go in Defence of their
Wives and Children. This they believed, and readily obeyed; and as soon
as the <i>Indians</i> were gone, he sent to the <i>French</i>, and supplied them
with Provisions and other Necessaries to carry them back. The <i>French</i>
Governor, in Order to reward so signal a Service, invited <i>Corlear</i> to
<i>Canada</i>; but as he went through the great Lake, which lies to the
Northward of <i>Albany</i>, his Canoe was overset, and he was drowned; and
from this Accident that Lake has ever since been called <i>Corlear</i>'s
<i>Lake</i>, by the People of <i>New-York</i>. There is a Rock in this Lake, on
which the Waves dash and fly up to a great Height; when the Wind blows
hard, the <i>Indians</i> believe, that an old <i>Indian</i> lives under this Rock,
who has the Power of the Winds; and therefore, as they pass it in their
Voyages over, they always throw a Pipe, or some other small Present to
this old <i>Indian</i>, and pray a favourable Wind. The <i>English</i> that pass
with them sometimes laugh at them, but they are sure to be told of
<i>Corlear</i>'s Death. Your great Countryman <i>Corlear</i> (say they) as he
passed by this Rock, jested at our Fathers making Presents to this <i>Old
Indian</i>, and in Derision turned up his Backside, but this Affront cost
him his Life.</p>

<p>In the following Spring the <i>Vice-Roy</i> and the <i>Governor of Canada</i>,
with twenty eight Companies of Foot, and all the Militia of the Colony,
marched into the Country of the <i>Mohawks</i>, with a Design to destroy this
Nation, which by their Wars not only prevented their Commerce with the
western <i>Indians</i>, but likewise often put their Colony in Danger. It
certainly was a bold Attempt, to march above 700 Miles from <i>Quebeck</i>
through vast unknown Forests. The <i>Mohawks</i> however, on their Approach,
Men, Women, and Children, retired into the Woods, and all that the
<i>French</i> were able to do, was to burn some Villages, and to murder some
old <i>Sachems</i> that (like the old Roman Senators,) chose rather to dye
than to desert their Houses.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> were so conceited before, of their Superiority over the
<i>Indians</i> in their Skill of War, and their Weapons, that they thought
they could not escape, but the little Honour or Advantage they got by
this Expedition lessened their Vanity, and made them desirous of Peace;
and the <i>Five Nations</i> remaining fearful of the <i>French fire Arms</i>, it
was without much Difficulty concluded in the Year 1667.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> however being naturally very enterprizing and
haughty, one of their Parties some Time after met with some <i>French</i> in
their hunting, and quarrelled with them. The <i>Indians</i> had the
Advantage, they killed several of the <i>French</i>, and carried one Prisoner
into their own Country. <i>Monsieur de Coursel</i> sent on this to threaten
the <i>Five Nations</i> with War, if they did not deliver up these Murderers;
and the <i>Five Nations</i>, to shew their publick Displeasure at this Breach
of Peace, sent <i>Agariata</i>, the Captain of the Company that did the
Mischief, with forty others, to beg Pardon; but <i>Monsieur Coursel</i> was
resolved to make an Example of <i>Agariata</i>, and ordered him to be hanged
in Sight of his Countrymen; and the <i>French</i> think that this Severity
was a great Means of preserving the Peace till the Year 1683.</p>

<p>The <i>Dutch</i>, who settled in the <i>New Netherlands</i>, now called
<i>New-York</i>, in 1609, entered into an Alliance with the Five Nations,
which continued without any Breach on either Side, till the <i>English</i>
gained this Country. The <i>Dutch</i> gained the Hearts of the <i>Five Nations</i>
by their kind Usage, and were frequently useful to the <i>French</i>, in
saving those of them that were prisoners from the Cruelty of the
<i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p>In 1664, <i>New-York</i> being taken by the <i>English</i>, they likewise
immediately entered into a Friendship with the <i>Five Nations</i>, which has
continued without the least Breach to this Day; and History, I believe,
cannot give an Instance of the most Christian or most Catholick Kings
observing a Treaty so strictly, and for so long a Time as these
Barbarians, as they are called, have done.</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> and <i>French</i> (Peace being every where settled) now
endeavoured to extend their Commerce and Alliances among the <i>Indian
Nations</i>, that live to the westward of <i>New-York</i>. The <i>French</i> however,
in their Measures, discovered always a Design of conquering and
commanding; for with this View <i>Mr. de Frontenac</i>, who had succeeded in
the Government of <i>Canada</i>, in the Year 1672, persuaded the <i>Five
Nations</i> to allow him to build a Fort on the north Side of <i>Cadarackui
Lake</i>, under Pretence of a Store for <i>Merchandise</i>, and the Security of
his Traders, and under the same Pretence built several other Forts at
some other considerable Places far in the Country.</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> and <i>Dutch</i>, on the contrary, prosecuted their Measures
only with the Arts of Peace, by sending People among the <i>Indians</i> to
gain their Affections, and to persuade them to come to <i>Albany</i> to
trade; but the War with the <i>Dutch</i>, which happened about this Time,
prevented even these honest Designs from having the Success they
otherwise might have had; for in the Year 1673, <i>New-York</i> being
surprised by the <i>Dutch</i>, and restored the next Year to the <i>English</i>,
the Alterations of Government, and of Masters, obstructed very much any
Measures that could have been taken for the publick Good. Their Trade
was likewise considerably hindered by the War which the <i>Five Nations</i>
had at that Time with the River Indians<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, which forced many of those
<i>Indians</i> to seek Shelter among the <i>Utawawas</i>, who fell under the
<i>French</i> Government at last; however, the <i>English</i>, <i>Dutch</i> and
<i>French</i> having all made Peace in <i>Europe</i>, and the Government of
<i>New-York</i> likewise having obtained a Peace between the <i>Five Nations</i>
and <i>Mahikandars</i> or <i>River Indians</i>, both the <i>English</i> and <i>French</i>
were at full Liberty to prosecute their Designs of extending their
Commerce among the <i>Indians</i>, which both did with very considerable
Success and Advantage to the Inhabitants of their respective Colonies.</p>

<p>But this Justice must be done to the <i>French</i>, that they far exceeded
the <i>English</i> in the daring Attempts of some of their Inhabitants, in
travelling very far among unknown <i>Indians</i>, discovering new Countries,
and every where spreading the Fame of the <i>French</i> Name and Grandeur.
The <i>Sieur Perot</i> travelled in the Year 1667 as far as <i>the Fall St.
Mary</i> beyond <i>Missilimakinak</i>, and having learned those <i>Indians</i>
Language, gained them over to his Country's Interest.</p>

<p>The Courage and Resolution of many of these Adventurers are deservedly
recorded by the <i>French</i>; but the <i>English</i> give it another Turn, and
say it is the Barrenness and Poverty of <i>Canada</i> that pushes the Men of
Spirit there, upon Enterprizes, that they would not have attempted, if
they had lived in the Province of <i>New-York</i>. The chief Reason, in my
Opinion, however, of the <i>French</i> having so far succeeded beyond the
<i>English</i> is, that the <i>Indian Affairs</i> are the particular Care of the
Governor and other principal Officers in <i>Canada</i>, who have the greatest
Knowledge and Authority; whereas those Affairs in <i>New-York</i> are chiefly
left to the Management of a few Traders with the <i>Indians</i>, who have no
Care for, or Skill in publick Affairs, and only mind their private
Interest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_1_III" id="CHAP_1_III"></a>CHAP. III.</h2>

<h4><i>Of the Transactions of the</i> Indians <i>of the</i> Five Nations <i>with the
neighbouring</i> English <i>Colonies</i>.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he <i>Five Nations</i> being now amply supplied by the <i>English</i> with
Fire-Arms and Ammunition, give full Swing to their warlike Genius, and
soon resolved to revenge the Affronts they had at any Time received from
the <i>Indian</i> Nations that lived at a greater Distance from them. The
nearest Nations, as they were attack'd, commonly fled to those that were
further off, and the <i>Five Nations</i> pursued them. This, together with a
Desire they had of conquering, or Ambition of making all the Nations
round them their Tributaries, or to acknowledge the <i>Five Nations</i> to be
so far their Masters, as to be absolutely directed by them in all
Affairs of Peace and War with their Neighbours, made them overrun great
Part of <i>North-America</i>. They carried their Arms as far South as
<i>Carolina</i>, to the Northward of <i>New-England</i>, and as far West as the
River <i>Mississipi</i>, over a vast Country, which extends twelve hundred
Miles in Length, from North to South, and about six hundred Miles in
breadth; where they intirely destroyed many Nations, of whom there are
now no Accounts remaining among the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p>These warlike Expeditions often proved troublesome to the Colonies of
<i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>; for not only the <i>Indians</i> that were Friends
to those Colonies became Victims to the Fury of the <i>Five Nations</i>, but
the Christian Inhabitants likewise were frequently involved in the same
Calamity.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> having a long Time felt the Inconveniencies and Dangers
they were in from this restless warlike Spirit of the <i>Five Nations</i>,
made use of this Time of Peace to guard against it for the future, and
were very diligent in pursuing the most prudent Measures. They sent some
of their wisest Priests and Jesuits to reside among them, and the
Governors of <i>New-York</i> were ordered, by the <i>Duke of York</i>, to give
these Priests all the Incouragement in their Power. The chief View of
these Priests was, to give the <i>Indians</i> the highest Opinion of the
<i>French Power</i> and Wisdom, and to render the <i>English</i> as suspected and
as mean as possible in their Eyes. They waited likewise for every
Opportunity to breed a Quarrel between the <i>English</i> and the <i>Indians</i>,
and to withdraw the <i>Five Nations</i> from fighting with those Nations that
traded to <i>Canada</i>. For these Purposes these Priests were instrumental
in turning the Resentment of the <i>Five Nations</i> against the <i>Indians</i>,
that were in Friendship with <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>. The Governor of
<i>Maryland</i>, on the other Hand, to prevent the ill Consequences, that
might happen by Wars between Nations that were in Friendship with the
<i>English</i>, and lived in their Neighbourhood, sent <i>Colonel Coursey</i>, in
the Year 1677, to <i>Albany</i>, to increase the Friendship between
<i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i> on the one Part, and the <i>Five Nations</i> on the
other; and, accordingly, both Sides gave mutual Promises at <i>Albany</i>:
But this good Understanding was soon shaken by some Parties of the
<i>Oneydoes</i>, <i>Onondagas</i>, and <i>Senekas</i>, who were out when this Treaty
was made, and were ignorant of it. One of them met with the <i>Susguehana
Indians</i>, who were in Friendship with <i>Maryland</i>, and fell upon them;
they killed four of the <i>Susguehanas</i>, and took six Prisoners. Five of
these Prisoners fell to the Share of the <i>Senekas</i>, who, as soon as they
arrived in their own Country, sent them back with Presents, to shew that
they kept their Promises with <i>Maryland</i>; but the <i>Oneydoes</i> detained
the Prisoner they had.</p>

<p>Another Party, that went against the <i>Canagesse Indians</i> (Friends of
<i>Virginia</i>) were surprised by a Troop of Horse, who killed one Man, and
took a Woman Prisoner: The <i>Indians</i>, in Revenge, killed four of the
Inhabitants, and carried away their Scalps, with six Christian
Prisoners.</p>

<p>The <i>Mohawks</i>, all this while, kept strictly to their Words, and
suffered none of their Men to go towards <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>.</p>

<p>There is Reason to think that the <i>Dutch</i>, who lived about <i>Albany</i> at
that Time, spirited up the <i>Indians</i> against the <i>English</i>; the national
Differences, that were then recent, bred a Rancour in their Spirits.
Some <i>Dutchmen</i> persuaded the <i>Oneydoes</i>, that the <i>English</i> at
<i>New-York</i> were resolved to destroy them, and put them into a terrible
Disturbance; for here the <i>Dutch</i> and the <i>French</i> Priests joined in the
same Measures. The Commandant at <i>Albany</i> hearing of this, sent two
Interpreters of the <i>Indian</i> Language, to persuade the <i>Oneydoes</i> to
come to <i>Albany</i>, in Order to be assured of the <i>English</i> Friendship,
and to have their Jealousy removed; which being done, <i>Swerise</i>, one of
the chief <i>Sachems</i> of the <i>Oneydoes</i>, excused his Countrymen at
<i>Albany</i> the fifteenth of <i>February</i> 1678/9, by laying the Blame on the
People of <i>Schenectady</i>, who had informed not one, but several of their
People, and at several Times, that the <i>English</i> designed to cut them
all off; and said, had they not Reason to believe the People of
<i>Schenectady</i>, who are Friends and Neighbours to the <i>English</i>? They
brought with them a Christian Woman and her Child, that had been taken
Prisoners, and restored them, praying the Governor to use his Interest
to have their People restored, that had been taken by the People of
<i>Virginia</i>; but they kept another Christian Woman and her two Children,
which they said they did only till such Time as their Prisoners should
be restored, or some <i>Canastoga Indians</i> given in their Place.</p>

<p>When the <i>Five Nations</i> make Peace with another Nation, that has taken
some of the <i>Five Nations</i> Prisoners, if these Prisoners be dead, or
cannot be restored, they usually demand some <i>Indians</i>, in Friendship
with the <i>Five Nations</i>, in their stead; who either are adopted in Place
of their dead Friends, or restored to their own Nation; and sometimes
they desire some of their Enemies to be given to them, and even those
frequently are adopted by a Father in Place of a Son, or by a Sister in
Place of a Brother, and, most frequently, by a Wife in Place of a
Husband lost in the Wars; but if they chance not to be agreeable to the
Relations, then they are certainly made Sacrifices to their Revenge.</p>

<p>Governor <i>Andross</i>, being acquainted by Letter with this last Proposal
of the <i>Oneydoes</i>, required the immediate Delivery of the Christian
Prisoners, and promised to write to <i>Virginia</i> to have the <i>Indian</i>
Prisoners sav'd. Some Presents being given to the <i>Oneydoes</i>, and they
promised to bring them in a Month's Time.</p>

<p>They, at the same Time, informed the Commandant at <i>Albany</i>, that eight
of their Men were then out against the People of <i>Virginia</i>; that they
knew nothing of what was now promised; and therefore, in Case they
should do any Harm, they desired that it might not be taken as a Breach
of their Promises they now made. They promised likewise to inform the
Governor of every Thing these Parties shou'd happen to do. In the last
Place they said, we shall be very sorry if any Thing should happen to
the Prisoners that we have promised to restore, lest it should create
some Jealousies of us, we hope that you will consider that they are
mortal. Accordingly, in <i>May</i> following, the <i>Oneydoes</i> brought the
other three Prisoners to <i>Albany</i>, and, on the Twenty-fourth of that
Month, <i>Swerise</i>, when he delivered them to the Commandant at <i>Albany</i>,
and the Commissioners for <i>Indian</i> Affairs, said,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p>"We are come to this Place with much Trouble, as we did last
Winter, and renew the Request we then made, that six <i>Indians</i>
be delivered to us in the Room of these six Christians, in Case
our People, who are Prisoners, be dead. None of us have gone out
against the Christians since we were last here; but we told you
then that some were then out, who knew nothing of the Governor's
Orders, and we desired, that if any Thing happened it might not
be taken ill. Now thirteen of our People, who went out against
our <i>Indian</i> Enemies, met eighteen Men on Horseback, as far from
any of the <i>English</i> Plantations as <i>Cahnuaga</i> is from <i>Albany</i>,
they fired upon our People; our Men, being Soldiers, returned
their Fire, and killed two Men and two Horses, and brought away
their Scalps.</p>

<p>"It would be convenient that the Governor tell the People of
<i>Virginia</i>, not to send their Men so far from Home; for if they
should meet our Parties in their Way against our Enemies, the
<i>Cahnowas</i>, whom the <i>English</i> call <i>Arogisti</i>, we cannot answer
for the Consequences.</p>

<p>"We have now observed the Governor's Orders, in bringing the
three other Christian Prisoners; and we trust the Affair of our
Prisoners wholly to the Governor.</p>

<p>"We have now performed our Promises: But where are our
Prisoners; or, if they be dead, the others in their Room, now
when it is so late in the Spring? However, we will still trust
this to the Governor."</p>

<p>Then delivering the Prisoners one by one, said, "We have, we
say, now performed our Promises, and are not ashamed. We hope
<i>Corlaer</i>, who governs the whole Country, will likewise do that,
of which he need not be ashamed.</p>

<p>"<i>Corlaer</i> governs the whole Land, from <i>New-York</i> to <i>Albany</i>,
and from thence to the <i>Senekas Land</i>; we, who are his
Inferiors, shall faithfully keep the Chain: Let him perform his
Promise, as we have ours, that the Chain be not broken on his
Side, who governs the whole Country."</p>

<p>Then the Commissioners gave them Presents for their kind Usage
of the Prisoners.</p>

<p>After which <i>Swerise</i> stood up again and said; "Let <i>Corlaer</i>
take Care, that the <i>Indian</i> Woman, that is wanting, be
restored, and, for those that are killed, others in their Room.
If <i>Corlaer</i> will not give Ear to us in this Affair, we will not
hereafter give Ear to him in any Thing."</p>

<p>Hearing afterwards, that these last Words were ill taken,
<i>Swerise</i>, with two more of the chief <i>Oneydoe Sachems</i>, excused
it, saying; "What we said, of not hearkening any more to
<i>Corlaer</i>, did not proceed from the Heart, but was spoken by Way
of Argument, to make <i>Corlaer</i> more careful to release our
People that are Prisoners; and you may be convinced it was so,
when you consider that it was said after your Answer, and
without laying down either Bever, or any Belt or Wampum, as we
always do, when we make Propositions<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>; therefore we desire,
that, if it be noted, it may be blotted out, and not made known
to <i>Corlaer</i>, for we hold firmly to our Covenant, as we said in
our Propositions."</p></div>

<p>They, at the same Time, told them, That the <i>Sinondowans</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> came to
them with eight Belts, desiring them no longer to prosecute the War with
the <i>Virginia Indians</i>, but to go to War against the <i>Dewaganas</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, a
Nation lying to the North-westward; and that the <i>Sennekas</i> did desire
them to set these Christians at Liberty, and to carry them to <i>Albany</i>;
all which we promised to do.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> continuing however still to be troublesome to
<i>Virginia</i>, that Government, in <i>September</i> following, sent Colonel
<i>William Kendall</i>, and Colonel <i>Southley Littleton</i>, to <i>Albany</i>, to
renew and confirm the Friendship between <i>Virginia</i> and the <i>Five
Nations</i>. Colonel <i>Littleton</i> died at <i>Albany</i>, before the <i>Indians</i>
arrived; and Colonel <i>Kendall</i> spoke first to the <i>Oneydoes</i>, and told
them in a set Speech, "That their People had taken away and destroyed
their Goods and People, and brought some of the Women and Children of
<i>Virginia</i> Captives into their Castles, contrary to that Faith and
Promise, and in Breach of the Peace made with Colonel <i>Coursey</i>, without
any the least Provocation, or Injury done, by the People of <i>Virginia</i>.
However, through the great Respect <i>Virginia</i> has to their Nations, and
by the Persuasions of the Governor of <i>New-York</i>, and the Information he
has given the Government of <i>Virginia</i>, that they had quietly and
peaceably delivered to him the Prisoners taken from <i>Virginia</i>, who were
returned safely; and their excusing the same, and Inclination to live
peaceably, without injuring <i>Virginia</i> for the future; the Government
of <i>Virginia</i> did forgive all the Damages the <i>Five Nations</i> have done
to the People of <i>Virginia</i>, though very great; provided that they, or
any living among them, for the future, do not offend, or molest the
People of <i>Virginia</i>, or <i>Indians</i> living among them."</p>

<p>He spoke to the <i>Mohawks</i> and <i>Sennekas</i>, separately from the
<i>Oneydoes</i>, because they had not done any Mischief, and promised them
kind and neighbourly Usage when they came to <i>Virginia</i>, and gave them
Presents; they returned the Compliment, with an Assurance of their
Friendship, and condoled Colonel <i>Littleton</i>'s Death, after the <i>Indian</i>
Manner, by a <b>Present of a Belt of black Wampum</b>, besides the Belt given,
on renewal of the Friendship.</p>

<p>The <i>Onnondagas</i> did not come till <i>November</i>; on the fifth of which
Month the <i>Virginia</i> Agent spoke to them, in the same Words he did to
the <i>Oneydoes</i>. It does not appear, by the Register of <i>Indian</i> Affairs,
what Answer the <i>Oneydoes</i> and <i>Onnondagas</i> made, but it is certain they
did not observe Friendship with <i>Virginia</i>, but molested them with
reiterated Incursions of their Parties. It is observable, however, that
these two Nations, and the <i>Cayugas</i>, only had <i>French</i> Priests among
them at that Time, and that none of the rest ever molested the
<i>English</i>; for which Reason, Colonel <i>Dongan</i>, notwithstanding the
Orders he had received from his Master, and that he himself was a
Papist, complained of the ill Offices these Priests did to the <i>English</i>
Interest, and forbid the <i>Five Nations</i> to entertain any of them; though
the <i>English</i> and <i>French</i> Crowns, while he was Governor of <i>New-York</i>,
seemed to be more than ever in strict Friendship.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> had no Hopes of persuading the <i>Five Nations</i> to break with
<i>New-York</i> directly, but they were in Hopes, that, by the <i>Indian</i>
Parties doing frequent Mischief in <i>Virginia</i>, the Government of
<i>New-York</i> would be forced to join, in resenting the Injury, and
thereby that Union, between the Government of <i>New-York</i> and the <i>Five
Nations</i>, would be broke, which always obstructed, and often defeated,
the Design the <i>French</i> had, of subjecting all <i>North America</i> to the
Crown of <i>France</i>. For this Reason, the Governors of <i>New-York</i> have
always, with the greatest Caution, avoided a Breach with these Nations,
on Account of the little Differences they had with the neighbouring
Colonies. These new Incursions of these two Nations were so troublesome
to the People of <i>Virginia</i>, that their Governor, the Lord <i>Howard of
Effingham</i>, thought it necessary, for their Security, to undertake a
Journey to <i>New-York</i>.</p>

<p>I shall give a particular Account of this Affair, which was thought of
such Consequence, that a Peer of <i>England</i> left his Government, and
travelled four-hundred Miles, to treat with the <i>Five Nations</i>; and
shall take this Opportunity of describing some Ceremonies they use, in
making Peace.</p>

<p>The <i>Sachems</i> of the <i>Five Nations</i> being called to <i>Albany</i>, eight
<i>Mohawks</i>, three <i>Oneydoes</i>, three <i>Onnondagas</i>, and three <i>Cayuga
Sachems</i>, met his Lordship there; and, on the thirteenth of <i>July</i>,
1684, he, accompanied by two of the Council of <i>Virginia</i>, spoke to the
<i>Sachems</i> as follows, in the Presence of Colonel <i>Thomas Dongan</i>,
Governor of <i>New-York</i>, and the Magistrates of <i>Albany</i>. The <i>Senekas</i>
being far off, were not then arrived.</p>

<h3><i>Proposals made by the Right Honourable</i> Francis <i>Lord</i> Howard
of Effingham, <i>Governor-general of his Majesty's Dominion of</i>
Virginia.</h3>

<h5><i>To</i></h5>

<h4><i>The</i> Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onnondagas, <i>and</i> Cayugas.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"It is now about seven Years, said he, since you (unprovoked)
came into <i>Virginia</i>, a Country belonging to the great King of
<i>England</i>, and committed several Murders and Robberies, carrying
away our Christian Women and Children Prisoners into your
Castles. All which Injuries we designed to have revenged on you,
but at the Desire of Sir <i>Edmond Andross</i>, then Governor-general
of this Country, we desisted from destroying you, and sent our
Agents, Colonel <i>William Kendal</i>, and Colonel <i>Southley
Littleton</i>, to confirm and make sure the Peace, that Colonel
<i>Coursey</i> of <i>Maryland</i> included us in, when he first treated
with you. We find, that as you quickly forgot what you promised
Colonel <i>Coursey</i>, so you have wilfully broke the Covenant-chain
which you promised our Agent, Colonel <i>Kendal</i>, should be kept
more strong and bright, if we of <i>Virginia</i> would bury, in the
Pit of Oblivion, the Injury then done us; which, upon Governor
<i>Andross</i>'s Intercession, and your Submission, we were willing
to forget: But you not at all minding the Covenant then made,
have every Year since, come into our Country in a war-like
Manner, under Pretence of fighting with our <i>Indians</i>, our
Friends and Neighbours, which you ought not to have done, our
Agent having included them likewise in the Peace. You not only
destroyed, and took several of them Prisoners, but you have also
killed and burnt our Christian People, destroying Corn and
Tobacco, more than you made Use of, killed our Horses, Hogs, and
Cattle; not to eat, but to let them lie in the Woods and stink:
This you did, when you were not denied any Thing you said you
wanted.</p>

<p>"I must also tell you, that, under the Pretence of Friendship,
you have come to Houses at the Heads of our Rivers (when they
have been fortified) with a white Sheet on a Pole, and have laid
down your Guns before the Fort; upon which, our People taking
you for Friends, have admitted your great Men into their Forts,
and have given them Meat and Drink, what they desired. After the
great Men had refreshed themselves, and desiring to return, as
they were let out of the Fort-gates, the young Men commonly
rushed into the Fort, and plundered the Houses, taking away, and
destroying all the Corn, Tobacco, and Bedding, and what else was
in the Houses. When they went away, they generally also took
several Sheep with them, and killed several Cows big with Calf,
and left them behind them cut to Pieces, and flung about, as if
it were in Defiance of us, and in Derision of our Friendship.
These, and many more Injuries that you have done us, have caused
me to raise Forces, to send to the Heads of our Rivers, to
defend our People from these Outrages, till I came to
<i>New-York</i>, to Colonel <i>Thomas Dongan</i>, your Governor-general,
to desire him, as we are all one King's Subjects, to assist me
in warring against you, to revenge the Christian Blood that you
have shed, and to make you give full Satisfaction for all the
Goods that you have destroyed: But by the Mediation of your
Governor, I am now come to <i>Albany</i> to speak with you, and to
know the Reason of your breaking the Covenant-chain, not only
with us and our neighbour <i>Indians</i>, but with <i>Maryland</i>, who
are great King <i>Charles</i>'s Subjects; for our <i>Indians</i> have
given King <i>Charles</i> their Land; therefore I, the Governor of
<i>Virginia</i>, will protect them, as your Governor, under the great
<i>Duke of York</i> and <i>Albany</i>, will henceforth you, when the Chain
of Friendship is made between us all.</p>

<p>"Now I have let you know, that I am sensible of all the Injuries
you have done us, and by the Desire of your Governor-general, I
am willing to make a new Chain with you for <i>Virginia</i>,
<i>Maryland</i>, and our <i>Indians</i>, that may be more strong and
lasting, even to the Word's End; so that we may be Brethren, and
great King <i>Charles</i>'s Children.</p>

<p>"I propose to you, <i>first</i>, That you call out of our Countries
of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>, all your young Men or Soldiers
that are now there.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly</i>, That you do not hinder or molest our friendly
<i>Indians</i> from hunting in our Mountains, it having been their
Country, and none of yours; they never go into your Country to
disturb any of you.</p>

<p>"<i>Thirdly</i>, Though the Damages you have done our Country be very
great, and would require a great deal of Satisfaction, which you
are bound to give; yet we assure you, that only by the
Persuasions of your Governor, who is at a vast deal of Trouble
and Charge for your Welfare, which you ever ought to
acknowledge, I have pass'd it by and forgiven you; upon this
Condition, that your People, nor any living among you, for the
future, ever commit any Incursions upon our Christians or
<i>Indians</i> living among us, or in <i>Maryland</i>.</p>

<p>"For the better Confirmation of the same, and that the Peace now
concluded may be lasting, I propose to have two <a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Hatchets
buried, as a final Determination of all Wars and Jarrings
between us; one on behalf of us and our <i>Indians</i>, and the other
for all your <i>Nations</i> united together, that ever did us any
Injury, or pretended to war against our <i>Indian</i> Friends, or
those of <i>Maryland</i>.</p>

<p>"And that nothing may be wanting for Confirmation thereof (if
you desire it) we are willing to send some of our <i>Indian
Sachems</i>, with an Agent, next Summer, about this Time, that they
may ratify the Covenant with you here, in this prefixed House,
where you may see and speak together as Friends.</p>

<p>"That the Covenant now made between us, in this prefixed House,
in the Presence of your Governor, may be firmly kept and
performed on your Parts, as it always has been on ours; and that
you do not break any one Link of the Covenant-chain for the
future, by your People's coming near our Plantations; when you
march to the Southward, keep to the Feet of the Mountains, and
do not come nigh the Heads of our Rivers, there being no
Bever-hunting there; for we shall not for the future, though you
lay down your Arms as Friends, ever trust you more, you have so
often deceived us."</p></div>

<p>The next Day the <i>Mohawks</i> answer'd first by their Speaker, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We must, in the first Place, say something to the other three
Nations, by Way of Reproof, for their not keeping the former
Chain, as they ought; and therefore we desire you, great <i>Sachem
of Virginia</i>, and you <i>Corlaer</i>, and all here present to give
Ear, for we will conceal nothing of the Evil they have done."
[Then turning to the other Nations.] "You have heard Yesterday
all that has been said; as for our Parts, we are free of the
Blame laid on us; we have always been obedient to <i>Corlaer</i>, and
have steadily kept our Chain with <i>Virginia</i>, <i>Maryland</i>, and
<i>Boston</i>; but ye are stupid and brutish, and have no
Understanding, we must stamp Understanding into you. Let the new
Chain made Yesterday be carefully preserved for the future. This
we earnestly recommend to you, for we are ready to cry for Shame
of you; let us be no more ashamed on your Account, but be
obedient, and <b>take this Belt</b>, to keep what we say in your
Memory.</p>

<p>"Hear now, now is the Time to hearken; the Covenant-chain had
very near slipt, by your not keeping it firmly. Hold it fast
now, when all former Evils are buried in the Pit.</p>

<p>"You <i>Oneydoes</i>, I speak to you as Children; be no longer
childish, or void of Understanding.</p>

<p>"You <i>Onondagas</i>, our Brethren, you are like deaf People, that
cannot hear, your Senses are covered with Dirt and Filth.</p>

<p>"You <i>Cayugas</i>, do not return into your former Ways. There are
three Things we must all observe.</p>

<p>"<i>First</i>, The Covenant with <i>Corlear</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, the Covenant
with <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>, with <i>Boston</i>. We
must stamp Understanding into you, that you may be obedient; and
<b>take this Belt</b> for a Remembrancer."</p></div>

<p>Then <i>Cadianne</i>, the same <i>Mohawk</i> Speaker, turning to my Lord, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We are very thankful to you, great <i>Sachem</i> of <i>Virginia</i>, that
you are persuaded by <i>Corlear</i>, our Governor, to forgive all
former Faults. We are very glad to hear you, and see your Heart
softened. <b>Take these three Bevers</b> as a Token.</p>

<p>"We thank the great <i>Sachem</i> of <i>Virginia</i> for saying, that the
Axe shall be thrown into the Pit. <b>Take these two Bevers</b>, as a
Token of our Joy and Thankfulness.</p>

<p>"We are glad that <i>Assarigoa</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> will bury in the Pit what is
past. Let the Earth be trod hard over it; or rather, let a
strong Stream run under the Pit, to wash the Evil away out of
our Sight and Remembrance, and that it may never be digged up
again.</p>

<p>"<i>Assarigoa</i>, you are a Man of Knowledge and Understanding, thus
to keep the Covenant-chain bright as Silver; and now again to
renew it, and make it stronger. (Then pointing to the three
other Nations, said,) But they are Chain-breakers. I lay down
this as a Token, that we <i>Mohawks</i> have preserved the Chain
intire on our Parts. <b>Gives two Bevers and a Racoon.</b></p>

<p>"The Covenant must be kept; for the Fire of Love of <i>Virginia</i>
and <i>Maryland</i> burns in this Place, as well as ours, and this
House of Peace must be kept clean. <b>Gives two Bevers.</b></p>

<p>"We now plant a Tree<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, whose Top will reach the Sun, and its
Branches spread far abroad, so that it shall be seen afar off;
and we shall shelter ourselves under it, and live in Peace
without Molestation. Here he <b>gave two Bevers.</b></p>

<p>"You proposed Yesterday, that if we were desirous to see the
<i>Indians</i> of <i>Virginia</i>, you are willing to send some of their
<i>Sachems</i> next Summer, about this Time, to this Place. This
Proposal pleases me very much, the sooner they come the better,
that we may speak with them in this House, which is appointed
for our speaking with our Friends; and <b>give two Belts</b> to confirm
it.</p>

<p>"You have now heard what Exhortation we have made to the other
three Nations; we have taken the Hatchet out of their Hands; we
now therefore pray, that both your Hatchets may likewise be
buried in a deep Pit. <b>Giving two Bevers.</b></p>

<p>"<i>Assarigoa</i>, some of us <i>Mohawks</i> are out against our Enemies,
that lie afar off, they will do you no Harm, nor plunder, as the
others do. Be kind to them, if they shall happen to come to any
of your Plantations; give them some Tobacco and some Victuals;
for they will neither rob nor steal, as the <i>Oneydoes</i>,
<i>Onnondagas</i>, and <i>Cayugas</i> have done.</p>

<p>"The <i>Oneydoes</i> particularly thank you, great <i>Sachem</i> of
<i>Virginia</i>, for consenting to lay down the Axe. The Hatchet is
taken out of all their Hands. <b>Gives a Belt.</b></p>

<p>"We again thank <i>Assarigoa</i>, that he has made a new Chain. Let
it be kept bright and clean, and held fast on all Sides; let not
any one pull his Arm from it. We include all the <i>four Nations</i>,
in giving this Belt.</p>

<p>"We again pray <i>Assarigoa</i>, to take the <i>Oneydoes</i> into his
Favour, and keep the Chain strong with them; for they are our
Children. <b>Gives a Belt.</b></p>

<p>"The <i>Oneydoes</i> <b>give twenty Bevers</b>, as a Satisfaction for what
they promised the Lord <i>Baltimore</i>, and desire that they may be
discharged of that Debt."</p></div>

<p>The two Governors told them, that they would use their Endeavours with
the Lord <i>Baltimore</i>, to persuade him to forgive what remained.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Indians</i> desired that the Hole might be dug, to bury the Axes,
<i>viz.</i> one in Behalf of <i>Virginia</i> and their <i>Indians</i>, another in
Behalf of <i>Maryland</i> and theirs, and three for the <i>Onnondagas</i>,
<i>Oneydoes</i>, and <i>Cayugas</i>. The <i>Mohawks</i> said, there was no Need of
burying any on their Account, for the first Chain had never been broke
by them.</p>

<p>Then the three Nations spoke by an <i>Onnondaga</i>, called <i>Thanohjanihta</i>,
who said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We thank the great <i>Sachem of Virginia</i>, that he has so readily
forgiven and forgot the Injuries that have been done; and we,
for our Parts, gladly catch at, and lay hold of the new Chain.
Then each of them delivered an Axe to be buried, and <b>gave a
Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"I speak in the Name of all three Nations, and include them in
this Chain, which we desire may be kept clean and bright like
Silver. <b>Gives a Belt.</b></p>

<p>"We desire that the Path may be open for the <i>Indians</i> under
<i>Assarigoa</i>'s Protection, to come safely and freely to this
Place, in order to confirm the Peace." <b>Gives six Fathom of
Wampum.</b></p></div>

<p>Then the Axes were buried in the south-east End of the Court-yard, and
the <i>Indians</i> threw the Earth upon them; after which the Lord <i>Howard</i>
told them, since now a firm Peace is concluded, we shall hereafter
remain Friends, and <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i> will send once in two or
three Years to renew it, and some of our <i>Sachems</i> shall come, according
to your Desire, to confirm it.</p>

<p>Last of all the <i>Oneydoes</i>, the <i>Onnondagas</i>, and <i>Cayugas</i>, jointly
sang the Peace-song, with Demonstrations of much Joy; and thanked the
Governor of <i>New-York</i> for his effectual Mediation with the Governor of
<i>Virginia</i> in their Favour.</p>

<p>Colonel <i>Dungan</i> had gained the Affections of the <i>Five Nations</i>, and
they esteemed him much.</p>

<p>They desired the <i>Duke of York</i>'s Arms to put upon their <i>Castles</i>,
which, from the Sequel of their Story, we may suppose they were told
would save them from the <i>French</i>. Colonel <i>Dungan</i> desired them to
call Home those of their Nations that had settled in <i>Canada</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. To
which they answered, <i>Corlear</i> keeps a Correspondence and Friendship
with <i>Canada</i>, and therefore he can prevail more than we can. Let
<i>Corlear</i> use his Endeavours to draw our <i>Indians</i> Home to their own
Country.</p>

<p>The Government of the <i>Massachusets Bay</i> had appointed Colonel
<i>Stephanus Cortland</i>, one of the Council of <i>New-York</i>, their Agent at
this Time, to renew their Friendship likewise with the <i>Five Nations</i>,
and to give them some small Presents; which was accordingly done.</p>

<p>The Governor of <i>New-York</i>, Colonel <i>Dungan</i>, concluded with this Advice
to them: Keep a good Understanding among yourselves; if any Difference
happen, acquaint me with it, and I will compose it. Make no Agreement
with the <i>French</i>, or any other Nation, without my Knowledge and
Approbation. Then he gave the Duke's Arms to be put up at each of their
Castles, in Hopes it might deter the <i>French</i> from attacking them, (as
they were threatened from <i>Canada</i>) by this so manifest a Declaration of
their being under the Protection of the Crown of <i>England</i>, when the two
Crowns were in the strictest Friendship; but it is probable the <i>French</i>
chose this very Time to attack them, to bring them off from that
Confidence they seemed to have in the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p>It may be proper, before I proceed, to insert here also a remarkable
Speech made by the <i>Onnondagas</i> and <i>Cayugas</i> to the two Governors, on
the second Day of <i>August</i>, <i>viz.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Brother</i> Corlear,</p>

<p>"Your <i>Sachem</i> is a great <i>Sachem</i>, and we are but a small
People; but when the <i>English</i> came first to <i>Manhatan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to
<i>Aragiske</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and to <i>Yakokranagary</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, they were then but a
small People, and we were great. Then, because we found you a
good People, we treated you kindly, and gave you Land; we hope
therefore, now that you are great, and we small, you will
protect us from the <i>French</i>. If you do not, we shall lose all
our Hunting and Bevers: The <i>French</i> will get all the Bevers.
The Reason they are now angry with us is, because we carry our
Bever to our Brethren.</p>

<p>"We have put our Lands and ourselves under the Protection of the
great <i>Duke of York</i>, the Brother of your great <i>Sachem</i>, who is
likewise a great <i>Sachem</i>.</p>

<p>"We have annexed the <i>Susquehana</i> River, which we won with the
Sword, to this Government; and we desire it may be a Branch of
the great Tree that grows in this Place, the Top of which
reaches the Sun, and its Branches shelter us from the <i>French</i>,
and all other Nations. Our Fire burns in your Houses, and your
Fire burns with us; we desire it may be so always. But we will
not that any of the great <i>Penn</i>'s People settle upon the
<i>Susquehana</i> River, for we have no other Land to leave to our
Children.</p>

<p>"Our young Men are Soldiers, and when they are provoked, they
are like Wolves in the Woods, as you, <i>Sachem</i> of <i>Virginia</i>,
very well know.</p>

<p>"We have put ourselves under the great <i>Sachem Charles</i>, that
lives on the other Side the great Lake. We <b>give you these two
white dressed Deer-skins</b>, to send to the great <i>Sachem</i>, that he
may write on them, and put a great red Seal to them, to confirm
what we now do; and put the <i>Susquehana</i> River above the Falls,
and all the rest of our Land under the great <i>Duke of York</i>, and
give that Land to none else. Our Brethren, his People, have been
like Fathers to our Wives and Children, and have given us Bread
when we were in Need of it; we will not therefore join
ourselves, or our Land, to any other Government but this. We
desire <i>Corlear</i>, our Governor, may send this our Proposition to
the great <i>Sachem Charles</i>, who dwells on the other Side the
great Lake, with this <b>Belt of Wampum</b>, and this other <b>smaller
Belt</b> to the <i>Duke of York</i> his Brother: And <b>we give you,
<i>Corlear</i>, this Bever</b>, that you may send over this Proposition.</p>

<p>"You great Man of <i>Virginia</i>, we let you know, that great <i>Penn</i>
did speak to us here in <i>Corlear</i>'s House by his Agents, and
desired to buy the <i>Susquehana</i> River of us, but we would not
hearken to him, for we had fastened it to this Government.</p>

<p>"We desire you therefore to bear witness of what we now do, and
that we now confirm what we have done before. Let your Friend,
that lives on the other Side the great Lake, know this, that we
being a free People, though united to the <i>English</i>, may give
our Lands, and be joined to the <i>Sachem</i> we like best. We <b>give
this Bever</b> to remember what we say."</p></div>

<p>The <i>Senekas</i> arrived soon after, and, on the fifth of <i>August</i>, spoke
to the Lord <i>Howard</i> in the following Manner:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We have heard and understood what Mischief hath been done in
<i>Virginia</i>; we have it as perfect as if it were upon our Fingers
Ends. O <i>Corlear</i>! we thank you for having been our Intercessor,
so that the Axe has not fallen upon us.</p>

<p>"And you <i>Assarigoa</i>, great <i>Sachem of Virginia</i>, we thank you
for burying all Evil in the Pit. We are informed, that the
<i>Mohawks</i>, <i>Oneydoes</i>, <i>Onnondagas</i>, and <i>Cayugas</i>, have buried
the Axe already; now we that live remotest off, are come to do
the same, and to include in this Chain the <i>Cahnawaas</i>, your
Friends. We desire therefore, that an Axe, on our Part, may be
buried with one of <i>Assarigoa</i>'s. O <i>Corlear! Corlear!</i> we thank
you for laying hold of one End of the Axe; and we thank you,
great Governor of <i>Virginia</i>, not only for throwing aside the
Axe, but more especially for your putting all Evil from your
Heart. Now we have a new Chain, a strong and a straight Chain,
that cannot be broken. The Tree of Peace is planted so firmly,
that it cannot be moved, let us on both Sides hold the Chain
fast.</p>

<p>"We understand what you said of the great <i>Sachem</i>, that lives
on the other Side the great Water.</p>

<p>"You tell us, that the <i>Cahnawaas</i> will come hither, to
strengthen the Chain. Let them not make any Excuse, that they
are old and feeble, or that their Feet are sore. If the old
<i>Sachems</i> cannot, let the young Men come. We shall not fail to
come hither, tho' we live farthest off, and then the new Chain
will be stronger and brighter.</p>

<p>"We understand, that because of the Mischief that has been done
to the People and Castles of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>, we must
not come near the Heads of your Rivers, nor near your
Plantations, but keep at the Foot of the Mountains; for tho' we
lay down our Arms, as Friends, we shall not be trusted for the
future, but looked on as Robbers. We agree however to this
Proposition, and shall wholly stay away from <i>Virginia</i>: And
this we do in Gratitude to <i>Corlear</i>, who has been at so great
Pains to persuade you, great Governor of <i>Virginia</i>, to forget
what is past. You are wise in giving Ear to <i>Corlear</i>'s good
Advice, for we shall now go a Path which was never trod before.</p>

<p>"We have now done speaking to <i>Corlear</i>, and the Governor of
<i>Virginia</i>; let the Chain be for ever kept clean and bright by
him, and we shall do the same.</p>

<p>"The other Nations from the <i>Mohawks</i> Country to the <i>Cayugas</i>,
have delivered up the <i>Susquehana</i> River, and all that Country,
to <i>Corlear</i>'s Government. We confirm what they have done by
<b>giving this Belt</b>."</p></div>

<p>Coll. <i>Bird</i>, one of the Council of <i>Virginia</i>, and <i>Edmond Jennings
Esq</i>; Attorney General of that Province, came with four <i>Indian
Sachems</i>, (according to the Lord <i>Howard</i>'s Promise) to renew and
confirm the Peace, and met the <i>Five Nations</i> at <i>Albany</i> in <i>September</i>
1685.</p>

<p>Coll. <i>Bird</i> accused them of having again broke their Promise, by taking
an <i>Indian</i> Girl from an <i>English</i> Man's House, and four <i>Indian</i> Boys
Prisoners.</p>

<p>They excused this, by its being done by the Parties that were out when
the Peace was concluded, who knew nothing of it; which Accident they had
provided against in their Articles. They said, the four Boys were given
to the Relations of those Men that were lost; and it would be difficult
to obtain their Restoration: But they at last promised to deliver them
up.</p>

<p>The <i>Senakas</i> and <i>Mohawks</i> declared themselves free of any Blame, and
chid the other Nations.</p>

<p>So that we may still observe the Influence which the <i>French</i> Priests
had obtained over those other Nations, and to what Christian like
Purpose they used it.</p>

<p>The <i>Mohawks</i> Speaker said, "Where shall I seek the Chain of Peace?
Where shall I find it but upon our Path<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>? And whither doth our Path
lead us, but into this House? This is a House of Peace;" after this he
sang all the Links of the Chain over. He afterwards sang by Way of
Admonition to the <i>Onondagas</i>, <i>Oneydoes</i>, and <i>Cayugas</i>, and concluded
all with a Song to the <i>Virginia Indians</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French Priests</i> however still employed their Influence over the
<i>Onnondagas</i>, <i>Cayugas</i>, and <i>Oneydoes</i>; and it was easy for them to
spirit up the <i>Indians</i> (naturally revengeful) against their old
Enemies. A Party of the <i>Oneydoes</i> went out two Years after this against
the <i>Wayanoak Indians</i>, Friends of <i>Virginia</i>, and killed some of the
People of <i>Virginia</i>, who assisted those <i>Indians</i>. They took six
Prisoners, but restored them at <i>Albany</i>, with an Excuse, that they did
not know they were Friends of <i>Virginia</i>. But Coll. <i>Dungan</i> on this
Occasion told them, That he only had kept all the <i>English</i> in
<i>North-America</i> from joining together to destroy them; that if ever he
should hear of the like Complaint, he would dig up the Hatchet, and join
with the rest of the <i>English</i> to cut them off Root and Branch; for
there were many Complaints made of him to the King by the <i>English</i>, as
well as by the Governor of <i>Canada</i>, for his favouring of them.</p>

<p>We have now gone through the material Transactions which the <i>Five
Nations</i> had with the <i>English</i>, in which we find the <i>English</i> pursuing
nothing but peaceable and Christian-like Measures; and the <i>Five
Nations</i> (tho' Barbarians) living with the People of <i>New-York</i>, like
good Neighbours and faithful Friends, and generally with all the
<i>English</i> also, except when they were influenced by the <i>Jesuites</i>; at
the same Time, one cannot but admire the Zeal, Courage, and Resolution
of these Jesuites, that would adventure to live among <i>Indians</i> at War
with their Nation; and the better to carry their Purposes, to comply
with all the Humours and Manners of such a wild People, so as not to be
distinguished by Strangers from meer <i>Indians</i>. One of them, named
<i>Milet</i>, remained with the <i>Oneydoes</i> till after the Year 1694; he was
advanced to the Degree of a <i>Sachem</i>, and had so great an Influence over
them, that the other Nations could not prevail with them to part with
him. While he lived with them, the <i>Oneydoes</i> were frequently turned
against the Southern <i>Indians</i> (Friends of the <i>English</i> southern
Colonies) and were always wavering in their Resolutions against the
<i>French</i> at <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>We shall now see what Effect the Policy of the <i>French</i> had, who pursued
very different Measures from the <i>English</i>.</p>

<h4><i>Mr</i>. De la Barre'<i>s Expedition, and some remarkable Transactions in</i>
1684.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he <i>French</i>, in the Time they were at Peace with the <i>Five Nations</i>,
built their Forts at <i>Taidonderaghi</i> and <i>Missilimakinak</i>, and made a
Settlement there. They carried on their Commerce among the numerous
Nations that live on the Banks of the great Lakes, and the Banks of the
<i>Mississipi</i>; they not only prosecuted their Trade among these Nations,
but did all they could to secure their Obedience, and to make them
absolutely subject to the Crown of <i>France</i>, by building Forts at the
considerable Passes, and placing small Garisons in them. They took in
short all the Precautions in their Power, not only to restrain the
<i>Indians</i> by Force, but likewise to gain their Affections, by sending
<i>Missionaries</i> among them. The only Obstruction they met with was from
the <i>Five Nations</i>, who introduced the <i>English</i> of <i>New-York</i> into the
Lakes to trade with the <i>Indians</i> that lived round them. This gave the
<i>French</i> much Uneasiness, because they foresaw, that the <i>English</i> would
not only prove dangerous Rivals, but that the Advantages which they had
in Trade, beyond what it was possible for the Inhabitants of <i>Canada</i> to
have, would enable the People of <i>New-York</i> so far to undersel them,
that their Trade would soon be ruined, and all the Interest lost which
they had gained with so much Labour and Expence. The <i>Five Nations</i>
likewise continued in War with many of the Nations, with the
<i>Chictaghicks</i> particularly, who yielded the most profitable Trade to
the <i>French</i>; and as often as they discovered any of the <i>French</i>
carrying Ammunition towards these Nations, they fell upon them, and took
all their Powder, Lead and Arms from them. This made the <i>French</i>
Traders afraid of travelling, and prevented their <i>Indians</i> from
hunting, and also lessened the Opinion they had of the <i>French</i> Power,
when they found that the <i>French</i> were not able to protect them against
the Insults of the <i>Five Nations</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Senakas</i> lie next to the Lakes, and nearest to the Nations with
whom the <i>French</i> carried on the greatest Trade, these People were so
averse to that Nation, that they would never receive any Priests among
them, and of Consequence were most firmly attach'd to the <i>English</i>
Interest, who supplied them with Arms and Powder (the Means to be
revenged of their Enemies.) For these Reasons Mr. <i>De la Barre</i>
(Governor of <i>Canada</i>) sent a Messenger to Coll. <i>Dungan</i>, to complain
of the Injuries the <i>Senakas</i> had done to the <i>French</i>, and to shew the
Necessity he was under to bring the <i>Five Nations</i> to Reason by Force of
Arms. This Messenger happening to arrive at the Time the <i>Indians</i> met
the Lord <i>Howard</i> at <i>Albany</i>, Coll. <i>Dungan</i> told the <i>Senakas</i> the
Complaints that the <i>French</i> Governor made of them. To which they gave
him the following Answer, in Presence of Mr. <i>De la Barre</i>'s Messenger,
on the 5th of <i>August</i> 1684.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We were sent for, and are come, and have heard what you have
said to us, that <i>Corlear</i> hath great Complaints of us, both
from <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Canada</i>. What they complain of from
<i>Canada</i> may possibly be true, that some of our young Men have
taken some of their Goods, but <i>Yonnendio</i> the Governor of
<i>Canada</i>, is the Cause of it. He not only permits his People to
carry Ammunition, Guns, Powder, Lead, and Axes to the
<i>Tuihtuih-ronoons</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> our Enemies, but sends them thither on
purpose. These Guns which he sends knock our Bever Hunters on
the Head, and our Enemies carry the Bevers to <i>Canada</i> that we
would have brought to our Brethren. Our Bever Hunters are
Soldiers, and could bear this no longer. They met some <i>French</i>
in their Way to our Enemies, and very near them, carrying
Ammunition, which our Men took from them. This is agreeable to
our Customs in War; and we may therefore openly own it, tho' we
know not whether it be practised by the Christians in such like
Cases.</p>

<p>"When the Governor of <i>Canada</i> speaks to us of the Chain, he
calls us Children, and saith, I am your Father, you must hold
fast the Chain, and I will do the same: I will protect you as a
Father doth his Children. Is this Protection, to speak thus with
his Lips, and at the same Time to knock us on the Head, by
assisting our Enemies with Ammunition?</p>

<p>"He always says, I am your Father, and you are my Children; and
yet he is angry with his Children, for taking these Goods.</p>

<p>"But, O <i>Corlear</i>! O <i>Assarigoa</i>! we must complain to you; you
<i>Corlear</i> are a Lord, and govern this Country; is it just that
our Father is going to fight with us for these Things, or is it
well done? We rejoiced when <i>La Sal</i> was sent over the great
Water; and when <i>Perot</i> was removed, because they had furnished
our Enemies with Ammunition; but we are disappointed in our
Hopes, for we find our Enemies are still supplied. Is this well
done? Yea, he often forbids us to make War on any of the Nations
with whom he trades; and at the same Time furnishes them with
all Sorts of Ammunition, to enable them to destroy us.</p>

<p>"Thus far in Answer to the Complaint the Governor of <i>Canada</i>
hath made of us to <i>Corlear</i>. <i>Corlear</i> said to us, that
Satisfaction must be made to the <i>French</i> for the Mischief we
have done them. This he said before he heard our Answer. Now let
him that hath Inspection over all our Countries, on whom our
Eyes are fixed, let him, even <i>Corlear</i>, judge and determine. If
you say that it must be paid, we shall pay it, but we cannot
live without free Bever Hunting.</p>

<p>"<i>Corlear</i>, hear what we say, we thank you for the Duke's Arms,
which you have given us to be put in our Castles, as a Defence
to them. You command them. Have we wandered out of the Way, as
the Governor of <i>Canada</i> says? We do not threaten him with War,
as he threatens us. What shall we do? Shall we run away, or
shall we sit still in our Houses? What shall we do? we speek to
him that governs and commands us.</p>

<p>"Now <i>Corlear</i>, and <i>Assarigoa</i>, and all People here present,
remember what we have answered to the Complaints of the Governor
of <i>Canada</i>; yea, we wish that what we here said may come to his
Ears." Then they <b>gave a Belt</b>.</p></div>

<p>Monsieur <i>De la Barre</i> at this Time was gone, with all the Force of
<i>Canada</i>, to <i>Cadarackui Fort</i>, and ordered the three Vessels to be
repaired which the <i>French</i> had built on <i>Cadarackui Lake</i>: His Design
was to frighten the <i>Five Nations</i> into his own Terms, by the Appearance
of the <i>French</i> Army, which consisted of 600 Soldiers of the regular
Troops, 400 <i>Indians</i>, and 400 Men that carried Provisions, besides 300
Men that he left to secure <i>Cadarackui Fort</i>, and the western
<i>Indians</i>, that he expected would join him. But while he was at this
Fort, the Fatigue of travelling in the Month of <i>August</i>, together with
the Unhealthiness of that Place (the Country thereabout being very
marshy) where he tarried six Weeks, occasioned so great a Sickness in
his Army, that he found himself unable to perform any Thing but by
Treaty; and therefore sent Orders to Monsr. <i>Dulhut</i>, who was come from
<i>Missilimakinak</i> with 600 Men, <i>French</i> and <i>Indians</i>, to stop. Monsr.
<i>De la Barre</i> passed across the Lake, with as many Men as were able to
travel, and arrived at the River which the <i>French</i> call <i>La Famine</i>, by
the <i>Indians</i> called <i>Kaihohage</i>, which falls into the South Side of
<i>Cadarackui Lake</i>, about thirty Miles from <i>Onnondago</i>. There were two
Villages of the <i>Five Nations</i> on the North Side of the Lake, about
fifteen Miles from the <i>French</i> Fort, consisting of those <i>Indians</i> that
had the most Inclination to the <i>French</i>: They provided the <i>French</i>
Army with Provisions, while they remained at the Fort; but it is
probable, sent an Account to their own Nations of every Thing that
happened; and that this was the Reason of the Usage they afterwards met
with from the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>When Monsr. <i>De la Barre</i> sent to Coll. <i>Dungan</i>, he was in Hopes, from
the strict Alliance that was then between the Crowns of <i>England</i> and
<i>France</i>, and from Coll. <i>Dungan</i>'s being a Papist, that he would at
least sit still till he had reduced the <i>Five Nations</i>. But none of
these Reasons permitted that Gentleman to be easy, while the <i>French</i>
attempted such Things, as in their Consequences would be of the highest
Degree prejudicial to the <i>English</i> Interest, and might put all the
<i>English</i> Colonies in <i>America</i> in Danger. Wherefore he dispatched the
publick Interpreter, with Orders to do every Thing in his Power to
prevent the <i>Five Nations</i> going to treat with Monsr. <i>De la Barre</i>.</p>

<p>The Interpreter succeeded in his Design with the <i>Mohawks</i>, and with
the <i>Senakas</i>, who promised that they would not go near the <i>French</i>
Governor: But he had not the like Success with the <i>Onnondagas,
Oneydoes</i>, and <i>Cayugas</i>, who had received the <i>French</i> Priests, for
they would not hear the Interpreter, but in Presence of the <i>French</i>
Priests, and Monsr. <i>la Main</i>, and three other <i>Frenchmen</i> that Monsr.
<i>De la Barre</i> had sent to persuade them to meet him at <i>Kaihohage</i>; they
gave the following Answer to the Interpreter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Arie</i>, you are <i>Corlear's Messenger</i>, <i>Ohquesse</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> (Monsr.
<i>la Maine</i>) is the Governor of <i>Canada</i>'s; and there<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> sits
our Father; <i>Yonnondio</i> acquainted us some Time ago, that he
would speak with us, before he would undertake any Thing against
the <i>Senakas</i>. Now he hath sent for all the Nations to speak
with him in Friendship, and that at a Place not far from
<i>Onnondaga</i>, even at <i>Kaihohage</i>. But our Brother <i>Corlear</i>
tells us, that we must not meet the Governor of <i>Canada</i> without
his Permission; and that if <i>Yonnondio</i> have any Thing to say to
us, he must first send to <i>Corlear</i> for Leave to speak with us.
<i>Yonnondio</i> has sent long ago to us to speak with him, and he
has lately repeated that Desire by <i>Onnissantie</i> the Brother of
our Father <i>Twirhaersira</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that sits there; he has not only
entreated us by our Father, but by two praying <i>Indians</i>, one an
<i>Onnondaga</i>, the other the Son of an old <i>Mohawk Sachem</i>,
<i>Connondowe</i>. They brought five great Belts of Wampum, not a
Fathom or two only, as you bring. Now <i>Ohquesse</i> has been sent
with three <i>Frenchmen</i>; <i>Yonnondio</i> not being content with all
this, has likewise sent <i>Dennehoct</i>, and two other <i>Mohawks</i>, to
persuade us to meet him, and to speak with him of good Things.
Should we not go to him after all this Intreaty, when he is come
so far, and so near to us? Certainly if we do not, we shall
provoke his Wrath, and not deserve his Goodness. You say we are
Subjects to the King of <i>England</i> and <i>Duke of York</i>, but we say
we are Brethren. We must take Care of ourselves. Those Arms
fixed upon the Posts, without the Gate, cannot defend us against
the Arms of <i>la Barre</i>. Brother <i>Corlear</i>, we tell you, that we
shall bind a Covenant Chain to our Arm, and to his, as thick as
that Post, (pointing to a Post of the House) be not
dissatisfied; should we not embrace this Happiness offered us,
<i>viz</i>. Peace, in the Place of War; yea, we shall take the Evil
Doers, the <i>Senekas</i>, by the Hand, and <i>la Barre</i> likewise, and
their Ax and his Sword shall be thrown into a deep Water. We
wish our Brother <i>Corlear</i> were present, but it seems the Time
will not permit of it."</p></div>

<p>Accordingly <i>Garangula</i>, one of the chief <i>Sachems</i> of the <i>Onondaga's</i>,
with thirty Warriors, went with Mr. <i>Le Maine</i>, to meet the Governor of
<i>Canada</i> at <i>Kaihohage</i>. After he had been two Days in the <i>French</i>
Camp, Monsr. <i>la Barre</i> spoke to him as follows, (the <i>French</i> Officers
making a Semi-circle on one Side, while <i>Garangula</i>, with his Warriors,
compleated the Circle on the other.)</p>

<p>
<i>Monsr</i>. De la Barre's <i>Speech to</i> Garangula.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The King, my Master, being informed that the <i>Five Nations</i>
have often infringed the Peace, has ordered me to come hither
with a Guard, and to send <i>Ohguesse</i> to the <i>Onondagas</i>, to
bring the chief <i>Sachem</i> to my Camp. The Intention of the great
King is, that you and I may smoke the <i>Calumet</i><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of Peace
together, but on this Condition, that you promise me, in the
Name of the <i>Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas</i>, and <i>Mohawks</i>, to
give intire Satisfaction and Reparation to his Subjects; and for
the future never to molest them.</p>

<p>"The <i>Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes</i>, and <i>Mohawks</i> have
robbed and abused all the Traders that were passing to the
<i>Illinois</i> and <i>Umamies</i>, and other <i>Indian</i> Nations, the
Children of my King. They have acted, on these Occasions,
contrary to the Treaty of Peace with my Predecessor. I am
ordered therefore to demand Satisfaction, and to tell them, that
in case of Refusal, or their plundering us any more, that I have
express Orders to declare War. This Belt confirms my Words. The
Warriors of the <i>Five Nations</i> have conducted the <i>English</i> into
the Lakes, which belong to the King, my Master, and brought the
<i>English</i> among the Nations that are his Children, to destroy
the Trade of his Subjects, and to withdraw these Nations from
him. They have carried the <i>English</i> thither, notwithstanding
the Prohibition of the late Governor of <i>New-York</i>, who foresaw
the Risque that both they and you would run. I am willing to
forget these Things, but if ever the like shall happen for the
future, I have express Orders to declare War against you. This
Belt confirms my Words. Your Warriors have made several
barbarous Incursions on the <i>Illinois</i> and <i>Umamies</i>; they have
massacred Men, Women, and Children, and have made many of these
Nations Prisoners, who thought themselves safe in their Villages
in Time of Peace. These People, who are my King's Children, must
not be your Slaves; you must give them their Liberty, and send
them back into their own Country. If the <i>Five Nations</i> shall
refuse to do this, I have express Orders to declare War against
them. This Belt confirms my Words.</p>

<p>"This is what I have to say to <i>Garangula</i>, that he may carry to
the <i>Senekas, Onondagas, Oneydoes, Cayugas</i>, and <i>Mohawks</i> the
Declaration which the King, my Master, has commanded me to make.
He doth not wish them to force him to send a great Army to
<i>Cadarackui</i> Fort, to begin a War which must be fatal to them.
He would be sorry that this Fort, that was the Work of Peace,
should become the Prison of your Warriors. We must endeavour, on
both Sides, to prevent such Misfortunes. The <i>French</i>, who are
the Brethren and Friends of the <i>Five Nations</i>, will never
trouble their Repose, provided that the Satisfaction which I
demand be given, and that the Treaties of Peace be hereafter
observed. I shall be extremely grieved if my Words do not
produce the Effect which I expect from them; for then I shall be
obliged to join with the Governor of <i>New-York</i>, who is
commanded by his Master to assist me, and burn the Castles of
the <i>Five Nations</i>, and destroy you. This Belt confirms my
Words."</p></div>

<p><i>Garangala</i> was very much surprised to find the soft Words of the
<i>Jesuit</i>, and of the Governor's Messengers, turned to such threatening
Language. This was designed to strike Terror into the <i>Indians</i>; but
<i>Garangula</i> having good Information from those of the <i>Five Nations</i>
living near <i>Cadarackui</i> Fort, of all the Sickness and other Misfortunes
which afflicted the <i>French</i> Army, it was far from producing the
designed Effect. All the Time that <i>Monsieur de la Barre</i> spoke,
<i>Garangula</i> kept his Eyes fixed on the End of his Pipe; as soon as the
Governor had done speaking, he rose up, and having walked five or six
Times round the Circle, he returned to his Place, where he spoke
standing, while <i>Monsieur de la Barre</i> kept his Elbow-Chair.</p>

<p>
Garangula's <i>Answer</i>.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Yonnondio</i>,</p>

<p>"I honour you, and the Warriors that are with me all likewise
honour you. Your Interpreter has finished your Speech; I now
begin mine. My Words make haste to reach your Ears, hearken to
them.</p>

<p>"<i>Yonnondio</i>, you must have believed, when you left <i>Quebeck</i>,
that the Sun had burnt up all the Forests which render our
Country inaccessible to the <i>French</i>, or that the Lakes had so
far overflown their Banks, that they had surrounded our Castles,
and that it was impossible for us to get out of them. Yes,
<i>Yonnondio</i>, surely you must have dreamt so, and the Curiosity
of seeing so great a Wonder has brought you so far. Now you are
undeceived, since that I and the Warriors here present are come
to assure you, that the <i>Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes</i>,
and <i>Mohawks</i> are yet alive. I thank you, in their Name, for
bringing back into their Country the <i>Calumet</i>, which your
Predecessor received from their Hands. It was happy for you,
that you left Underground that murdering Hatchet, that has been
so often dyed in the Blood of the <i>French</i>. Hear, <i>Yonnondio</i>, I
do not sleep, I have my Eyes open, and the Sun, which enlightens
me, discovers to me a great Captain at the Head of a Company of
Soldiers, who speaks as if he were dreaming. He says, that he
only came to the Lake to smoke on the great <i>Calumet</i> with the
<i>Onondagas</i>. But <i>Garangula</i> says, that he sees the contrary,
that it was to knock them on the Head, if Sickness had not
weakened the Arms of the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>"I see <i>Yonnondio</i> raving in a Camp of sick Men, whose Lives the
great Spirit has saved, by inflicting this Sickness on them.
Hear, <i>Yonnondio</i>, our Women had taken their Clubs, our Children
and old Men had carried their Bows and Arrows into the Heart of
your Camp, if our Warriors had not disarmed them, and kept them
back, when your Messenger, <i>Ohguesse</i>, came to our Castles. It
is done, and I have said it. Hear, <i>Yonnondio</i>, we plundered
none of the <i>French</i>, but those that carried Guns, Powder, and
Ball to the <i>Iwikties</i> and <i>Chictaghicks</i>, because those Arms
might have cost us our Lives. Herein we follow the Example of
the Jesuits, who stave all the Caggs of Rum brought to our
Castles, lest the drunken <i>Indians</i> should knock them on the
Head. Our Warriors have not Bevers enough to pay for all these
Arms, that they have taken, and our old Men are not afraid of
the War. This Belt preserves my Words.</p>

<p>"We carried the <i>English</i> into our Lakes, to trade there with
the <i>Utawawas</i> and <i>Quatoghies</i>, as the <i>Adirondacks</i> brought
the <i>French</i> to our Castles, to carry on a Trade which the
<i>English</i> say is theirs. We are born free, we neither depend on
<i>Yonnondio</i> nor <i>Corlear</i>.</p>

<p>"We may go where we please, and carry with us whom we please,
and buy and sell what we please: If your Allies be your Slaves,
use them as such, command them to receive no other but your
People. This Belt preserves my Words.</p>

<p>"We knock'd the <i>Twihtwies</i> and <i>Chictaghicks</i> on the Head,
because they had cut down the Trees of Peace, which were the
Limits of our Country. They have hunted Bevers on our Lands:
They have acted contrary to the Customs of all <i>Indians</i>; for
they left none of the Bevers alive, they killed both Male and
Female. They brought the <i>Satanas</i><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> into their Country, to
take Part with them, after they had concerted ill Designs
against us. We have done less than either the <i>English</i> or
<i>French</i>, that have usurped the Lands of so many <i>Indian</i>
Nations, and chased them from their own Country. This Belt
preserves my Words. Hear, <i>Yonnondio</i>, what I say is the Voice
of all the <i>Five Nations</i>; hear what they answer, open your Ears
to what they speak: The <i>Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneydoes</i>,
and <i>Mohawks</i> say, that when they buried the Hatchet at
<i>Cadarackui</i> (in the Presence of your Predecessor) in the Middle
of the Fort, they planted the Tree of Peace in the same Place,
to be there carefully preserved, that, in Place of a Retreat for
Soldiers, that Fort might be a Rendezvous for Merchants; that,
in Place of Arms and Ammunition of War, Bevers and Merchandise
should only enter there.</p>

<p>"Hear, <i>Yonnondio</i>, take Care for the future, that so great a
Number of Soldiers, as appear there, do not choak the Tree of
Peace planted in so small a Fort. It will be a great Loss, if
after it had so easily taken Root, you should stop its Growth,
and prevent its covering your Country and ours with its
Branches. I assure you, in the Name of the <i>Five Nations</i>, that
our Warriors shall dance to the <i>Calumet</i> of Peace under its
Leaves, and shall remain quiet on their Matts, and shall never
dig up the Hatchet, till their Brethren, <i>Yonnondio</i> or
<i>Corlear</i>, shall either jointly or separately endeavour to
attack the Country, which the great Spirit has given to our
Ancestors. This Belt preserves my Words, and this other, the
Authority which the <i>Five Nations</i> has given me."</p></div>

<p>Then <i>Garangula</i> addressing himself to Monsieur <i>le Maine</i>, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Take Courage, <i>Ohguesse</i>, you have Spirit, speak, explain my
Words, forget nothing, tell all that your Brethren and Friends
say to <i>Yonnondio</i>, your Governor, by the Mouth of <i>Garangula</i>,
who loves you, and desires you to accept of <b>this Present of
Bever</b>, and take Part with me in my Feast, to which I invite you.
This Present of Bever is sent to <i>Yonnondio</i> on the Part of the
<i>Five Nations</i>."</p></div>

<p>When <i>Garangula</i>'s Harangue was explained to Monsieur <i>de la Barre</i>, he
returned to his Tent, much inraged at what he had heard.</p>

<p><i>Garangula</i> feasted the <i>French</i> Officers, and then went Home, and
Monsieur <i>de la Barre</i> set out in his Way towards <i>Montreal</i>; and as
soon as the General was imbarked, with the few Soldiers that remained in
Health, the Militia made the best of their Way to their own Habitations,
without any Order or Discipline.</p>

<p>Thus a very chargeable and fatiguing Expedition (which was to strike the
Terror of the <i>French</i> Name into the stubborn Hearts of the <i>Five
Nations</i>) ended in a Scold between the <i>French</i> General and an old
<i>Indian</i>.</p>

<h4><i>The</i> English <i>attempt to trade in the Lakes</i>, <i>and the</i> French <i>attack
the</i> Senekas.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he <i>Marquis de Nonville</i> having now succeeded Monsieur <i>de la Barre</i>,
in the Year 1685, and having brought a considerable Reinforcement of
Soldiers with him, resolved to recover the Honour the <i>French</i> had lost
in the last Expedition, and revenge the Slaughter the <i>Five Nations</i>
continued to make of the <i>Twihtwies</i> and <i>Chictaghicks</i>, who had put
themselves under the <i>French</i> Protection; for the <i>Five Nations</i> having
intirely subdued the <i>Chictaghicks</i><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, after a six Years War, they
resolved next to fall upon the <i>Twihtwies</i>, and to call them to an
Account for the Disturbance they had given some of their People in their
Bever Hunting. The <i>Five Nations</i> have few or no Bever in their own
Country, and for that Reason are obliged to hunt at a great Distance,
which often occasions Disputes with their Neighbours about the Property
of the Bever. The Bever is the most valuable Branch of the <i>Indian</i>
Trade, and as the <i>Twihtwies</i> carried their Bevers to the <i>French</i>, the
<i>English</i> encouraged the <i>Five Nations</i> in these Expeditions, and
particularly, in the Beginning of the Year 1687, made the <i>Five Nations</i>
a Present of a Barrel of Powder, when their whole Force was preparing to
go against the <i>Twihtwies</i>. The <i>English</i> were the better pleased with
this War, because they thought that it would divert the <i>Five Nations</i>
from the <i>Virginia Indians</i>: But the <i>French</i> were resolved to support
their Friends more effectually by a powerful Diversion, and to change
the Seat of the War.</p>

<p>For this Purpose Mr. <i>de Nonville</i> sent, in <i>May</i> 1687, great Quantities
of Provision to <i>Cadarackui</i> Fort, and gathered the whole Force of
<i>Canada</i> to <i>Montreal</i>. His Army consisted of fifteen hundred <i>French</i>
of the regular Troops and Militia, and five hundred <i>Indians</i> that lived
near <i>Montreal</i> and <i>Quebeck</i>. He sent likewise Orders to the Commandant
at <i>Missilimakinak</i> to assemble all the Nations living round him, and
to march them to <i>Oniagara</i>, in order to join the Forces of <i>Canada</i>
designed against the <i>Senekas</i>, and the other Officers posted among the
<i>Indians</i> Westward had the like Orders.</p>

<p>The <i>Twihtwies</i> received the Hatchet with Joy from the Hands of the
<i>French</i> Officer. The <i>Outagamies</i>, <i>Kikabous</i>, and <i>Maskuticks</i>, who
were not used to Canoes, were at first persuaded to join the
<i>Twihtwies</i>, who were to march by Land to <i>Teuchsagrondie</i>, where there
was a <i>French</i> Fort, at which they were to be supplied with Ammunition.
But after the <i>French</i> Officer left them, the <i>Utagamies</i> and
<i>Maskuticks</i> were dissuaded by some of the <i>Mahikander Indians</i>, who
happened to be with a neighbouring Nation at that Time.</p>

<p>The <i>Putewatemies, Malhominies</i>, and <i>Puans</i> offered themselves
willingly, and went to the Rendezvous at <i>Missilimakinak</i>; where they
were received by the <i>Utawawas</i> with all the Marks of Honour usually
paid to Soldiers. Though the <i>Utawawas</i> had no Inclination to the
present Enterprize; they could not tell however how to appear against
it, otherwise than by inventing what Delays they could, to prevent their
March.</p>

<p>In the mean while a Canoe arrived, which was sent by Mr. <i>de Nonville</i>,
with his Orders to the Officers. This Canoe, in her Passage, discovered
some <i>English</i>, commanded by Major <i>Mac Gergory</i>, in their Way to
<i>Teiodonderaghie</i>. The <i>English</i> thought (after they had an Account of
the new Alliance their King had entered into with the <i>French</i>) that the
<i>French</i> would not disturb them in prosecuting a Trade with the
<i>Indians</i> every where, and that the Trade would be equally free and open
to both Nations. With these Hopes a considerable Number of Adventurers
went out, under the Conduct of Major <i>Mac Gergory</i>, to trade with the
<i>Indians</i> that lived on the Banks of the Lakes; and that they might be
the more welcome, persuaded the <i>Five Nations</i> to set all the
<i>Dionondadie</i> Prisoners at Liberty, who went along with the <i>English</i>,
and conducted them towards <i>Missilimakinak</i>, or <i>Teiodonderaghie</i>; but
the <i>English</i> found themselves mistaken, for the <i>French</i> Commandant at
<i>Teiodonderaghie</i>, as soon as he had Notice of this, sent three-hundred
<i>French</i> to intercept the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The <i>Utawawas</i> and <i>Dionondadies</i> having likewise an Account of the
<i>English</i>, designed to support their own Independency, and to incourage
the <i>English</i> Trade. The return of the <i>Dionondadie</i> Prisoners made that
Nation very hearty in favouring the <i>English</i>, they therefore marched
immediately off, with Design to join Major <i>Mac Gergory</i>; but the
<i>Utawawas</i> were divided in their Inclinations, their Chief, with about
thirty more, joined the <i>French</i>, the rest remained in suspence, and
stood neuter.</p>

<p>The <i>Utawawas</i> thus wavering, disconcerted the Measures of the
<i>Dionondadies</i>, for they began to suspect the <i>Utawawas</i>, and therefore
immediately returned to secure their Wives and Children that they had
left near the <i>French</i> Fort with the <i>Utawawas</i>. The <i>English</i> and their
Effects were seized without any Opposition, and were carried to the
<i>French</i> Fort at <i>Teiodonderaghie</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> brought great Quantities of Rum with them, (which the
<i>Indians</i> love more than their Lives) and the <i>French</i> being afraid,
that if the <i>Indians</i> took to Drinking, they would grow ungovernable,
did what they could to keep them from it. They were most concerned that
the <i>Putewatemies</i> (who had no Knowledge of the <i>English</i>, or of that
bewitching Liquor, and were firmly attached to the <i>French</i>) should not
taste it.</p>

<p>The <i>Utawawas</i> still contrived Delays to the March, and having got some
of the <i>Putewatemies</i> privately by themselves, they offered them a Cag
of Rum, and said: "We are all Brethren, we ought to make one Body, and
to have one Soul. The <i>French</i> invite us to war against the <i>Five
Nations</i>, with Design to make us Slaves, and that we should make
ourselves the Tools to effect it. As soon as they shall have destroyed
the <i>Five Nations</i>, they will no longer observe any Measures with us,
but use us like those Beasts they tie to their Ploughs. Let us leave
them to themselves, and they will never be able to accomplish any Thing
against the <i>Five Nations</i>."</p>

<p>But the <i>Putewatemies</i> had entertained such Notions of the <i>French</i>, as
made them deaf to the Politicks of the <i>Utawawas</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> however grew jealous of these Caballings, and therefore
resolved to delay their March no longer, and would not stay one Day more
for the <i>Utawawas</i>, who desired only so much Time to pitch their Canoes,
and went away without them.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Tonti</i>, Commandant among the <i>Chictaghicks</i>, met with another Party
of the <i>English</i> of about thirty Men, in Lake <i>Erie</i>, as he marched with
the <i>Chicktaghicks</i> and <i>Twihtwies</i>, and other neighbouring Nations, to
the general Rendezvous. He fell upon the <i>English</i>, plundered them, and
took them Prisoners. The <i>French</i> divided all the Merchandize among the
<i>Indians</i>, but kept the Rum to themselves, and got all drunk. The
<i>Deonondadie</i> Prisoners, that conducted the <i>English</i>, joined with the
<i>Mahikander</i> <i>Indians</i> that were among Mr. <i>Tonti</i>'s <i>Indians</i> (who had
privately dissuaded about twenty of the neighbouring Nations from going
with <i>Tonti</i>) and endeavoured to persuade all the <i>Indians</i> to fall upon
the <i>French</i>, while they were drunk, and destroy them; saying, the
<i>French</i> are a proud, imperious, covetous People, that sell their Goods
at an extravagant Price; the <i>English</i> are a good natured honest
People, and will furnish you with every Thing at reasonable Rates. But
these Arguments were to no Purpose, for these far <i>Indians</i> had
entertained an extraordinary Opinion of the <i>French</i> Power, and knew
nothing of the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> and <i>Putewatemies</i> being gone from <i>Teiodonderaghie</i>, the
<i>Utawawas</i> began to be afraid of the <i>French</i> Resentment, and therefore,
the better to keep up the Colour they had put on their Delays, marched
over Land, with all possible Expedition, to the general Rendezvous near
<i>Oniagara</i>, where all the <i>French</i> Force, both Christians and <i>Indians</i>,
was to meet.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> being informed of the <i>French</i> Preparations, laid
aside their Design against the <i>Twihtwies</i>, and prepared to give the
<i>French</i> a warm Reception. Upon this the Priest at <i>Onondaga</i> left them,
but the Priest at <i>Oneydo</i> had the Courage to stay. The <i>Senekas</i> came
to <i>Albany</i> to provide Ammunition, and the Commissioners made them a
Present of a considerable Quantity of Powder and Lead, besides what they
purchased. They were under a great deal of Concern when they took Leave
of the Commissioners, and said, "Since we are to expect no other
Assistance from our Brethren, we must recommend our Wives and Children
to you, who will fly to you, if any Misfortune shall happen to us. It
may be we shall never see you again; for we are resolved to behave so,
as our Brethren shall have no Reason to be ashamed of us."</p>

<p>We must now return to Monsieur <i>de Nonville</i>'s Army.</p>

<p>Monsieur <i>Campagnie</i> marched eight or ten Days before the rest of the
Army, with between two and three hundred <i>Cannadians</i>. As soon as they
arrived at <i>Cadarackui</i>, they surprised two Villages of the <i>Five
Nations</i>, that were settled about eight Leagues from that Place, to
prevent their giving any Intelligence to their own Nation of the
<i>French</i> Preparations, or of the State of their Army, as it was supposed
they did in the last Expedition under Monsieur <i>de la Barre</i>. These
People were surprised when they least expected it, and by them from whom
they feared no Harm, because they had settled there at the Invitation,
and on the Faith of the <i>French</i>. They were carried in cold Blood to the
Fort, and tied to Stakes, to be tormented by the <i>French Indians</i>,
(Christians, as they call them) while they continued singing in their
country Manner, and upbraiding the <i>French</i> with their Perfidy and
Ingratitude.</p>

<p>While Monsieur <i>de Nonville</i> was at <i>Cadarackui</i> Fort, he had an
Account, that the <i>Chicktaghicks</i> and <i>Twihtwies</i> waited for the
<i>Quatoghies</i> and <i>Utawawas</i> at Lake <i>St. Clair</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, with whom they
designed to march to the general Rendezvous, at the Mouth of the
<i>Senekas</i> River. For this Expedition was chiefly designed against the
<i>Senekas</i>, who had absolutely refused to meet Monsieur <i>de la Barre</i>,
and were most firmly attached to the <i>English</i>. The <i>Senekas</i>, for this
Reason, were designed to be made Examples of the <i>French</i> Resentment to
all the other Nations of <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p>The Messenger having assured the General, that it was Time to depart, in
order to meet with the western <i>Indians</i>, that came to his Assistance,
he set out the twenty-third of <i>June</i>, and sent one Part of his Army in
Canoes, along the North Shore of the Lake, while he, with the other
Part, passed along the South, that no Accidents of Wind might prevent
the one or the other reaching, within the Time appointed, at the Place
the <i>Indians</i> were to meet him. It happened, by reason of the good
Weather, that both arrived on the same Day, and joined the western
<i>Indians</i> at <i>Trondequat</i>, As soon as the Men were put on Shore, they
hawled up the Canoes, and began a Fort, where four hundred Men were left
to guard the Canoes, and the Baggage. Here a young <i>Cannadian</i> was shot
to Death, as a Deserter, for conducting the <i>English</i> into the Lakes,
though the two Nations were not only at Peace, but their Kings in
stricter Friendship than usual. But this Piece of Severity is not to be
wondered at, when this War was undertaken, chiefly to put a Stop to the
<i>English</i> Trade, which now began to extend itself far into the
Continent, and would in its Consequence ruin theirs. The next Day the
Army began to march towards the chief Village of the <i>Senekas</i>, which
was only seven Leagues distant, every Man carrying ten Biskets for his
Provision. The <i>Indian</i> Traders made the Van with Part of the <i>Indians</i>,
the other Part marched in the Rear, while the regular Troops and Militia
composed the main Body. The Army marched four Leagues the first Day
without discovering any Thing; the next Day the Scouts advanced before
the Army, as far as the Corn of the Villages, without seeing any Body,
though they passed within Pistol-shot of five-hundred <i>Senekas</i>, that
lay on their Bellies, and let them pass and repass without disturbing
them.</p>

<p>On the Report which they made, the <i>French</i> hastened their March, in
hopes to overtake the Women, Children, and old Men; for they no longer
doubted of all being fled. But as soon as the <i>French</i> reached the Foot
of a Hill, about a Quarter of a League from the Village, the <i>Senekas</i>
suddenly raised the Warshout, with a Discharge of their Fire-arms. This
put the regular Troops, as well as the Militia, into such a Fright, as
they marched through the Woods, that the Battalions immediately divided,
and run to the Right and Left, and, in the Confusion, fired upon one
another. When the <i>Senekas</i> perceived their Disorder, they fell in among
them pell-mell, till the <i>French Indians</i>, more used to such Way of
fighting, gathered together and repulsed the <i>Senekas</i>. There were
(according to the <i>French</i> Accounts) a hundred <i>Frenchmen</i>, ten <i>French
Indians</i>, and about fourscore <i>Senekas</i> killed, in this Rencounter.</p>

<p>Monsieur <i>de Nonville</i> was so dispirited with the Fright that his Men
had been put into, that his <i>Indians</i> could not persuade him to pursue.
He halted the remainder of that Day. The next Day he marched on with
Design to burn the Village, but when he came there, he found that the
<i>Senekas</i> had saved him the Trouble; for they had laid all in Ashes
before they retired. Two old Men only were found in the Castle, who were
cut into Pieces and boiled to make Soup for the <i>French</i> Allies. The
<i>French</i> staid five or six Days to destroy their Corn, and then marched
to two other Villages, at two or three Leagues distance. After they had
performed the like Exploits in those Places, they returned to the Banks
of the Lake.</p>

<p>Before the <i>French</i> left the Lakes, they built a Fort of four Bastions
at <i>Oniagara</i>, on the South-side of the Straights, between Lake <i>Erie</i>
and <i>Cadarackui</i> Lake, and left a hundred Men, with eight Months
Provisions in it. But this Garison was so closely blocked up by the
<i>Five Nations</i>, that they all died of Hunger, except seven or eight, who
were accidentally relieved by a Party of <i>French Indians</i>.</p>

<p>The western <i>Indians</i>, when they parted from the <i>French</i> General, made
their Harangues, as usual, in which they told him, with what Pleasure
they saw a Fort so well placed to favour their Designs against the <i>Five
Nations</i>, and that they relied on his never finishing the War, but with
the Destruction of the <i>Five Nations</i>, or forcing them to abandon their
Country. He assured them, that he would act with such Vigour, that they
would soon see the <i>Five Nations</i> driven into the Sea.</p>

<p>He sent a Detachment of Soldiers to <i>Teiodonderaghie</i>, and in his Return
to <i>Canada</i>, which was by the North Side of the Lake, he left a
sufficient Number of Men, and a Quantity of Provisions, at <i>Cadarackui</i>
Fort.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> having got nothing but dry Blows by this Expedition, sent
thirteen of the <i>Indians</i>, that they surprised at <i>Cadarackui</i>, to
<i>France</i>, as Trophies of their Victory, where they were put into the
Galleys, as Rebels to their King.</p>

<h4><i>Colonel</i> Dongan's <i>Advice to the</i> Indians. Adario's <i>Enterprize</i>, <i>and</i>
Montreal <i>sacked by the</i> Five Nations.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>olonel <i>Dongan</i>, who had the <i>Indian</i> Affairs very much at Heart, met
the <i>Five Nations</i> at <i>Albany</i> as soon as possible after the <i>French</i>
Expedition, and spoke to them on the fifth of <i>August</i>, in the following
Words, <i>viz</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you here in this House, and am heartily
glad that you have sustained no greater Loss by the <i>French</i>,
though I believe it was their Intention to destroy you all, if
they could have surprised you in your Castles.</p>

<p>"As soon as I heard their Design to war with you, I gave you
Notice, and came up hither myself, that I might be ready to give
all the Assistance and Advice that so short a Time would allow
me.</p>

<p>"I am now about sending a Gentleman to <i>England</i>, to the King,
my Master, to let him know, that the <i>French</i> have invaded his
Territories on this Side of the great Lake, and warred upon the
Brethren his Subjects. I therefore would willingly know, whether
the Brethren have given the Governor of <i>Canada</i> any Provocation
or not; and if they have, how, and in what Manner; because I am
obliged to give a true Account of this Matter. This Business may
cause a War between the King of <i>England</i> and the <i>French</i> King,
both in <i>Europe</i> and here, and therefore I must know the Truth.</p>

<p>"I know the Governor of <i>Canada</i> dare not enter into the King of
<i>England</i>'s Territories, in a hostile Manner, without
Provocation, if he thought the Brethren were the King of
<i>England</i>'s Subjects; but you have, two or three Years ago, made
a Covenant-chain with the <i>French</i>, contrary to my Command,
(which I knew could not hold long) being void of itself among
the Christians; for as much as Subjects (as you are) ought not
to treat with any foreign Nation, it not lying in your Power,
you have brought this Trouble on your selves, and, as I believe,
this is the only Reason of their falling on you at this Time.</p>

<p>"Brethren, I took it very ill, that after you had put yourselves
into the Number of the great King of <i>England</i>'s Subjects, you
should ever offer to make Peace or War without my Consent. You
know that we can live without you, but you cannot live without
us. You never found that I told you a Lye, and I offered you the
Assistance you wanted, provided that you would be advised by me;
for I know the <i>French</i> better than any of you do.</p>

<p>"Now since there is a War begun upon you by the Governor of
<i>Canada</i>, I hope without any Provocation by you given, I desire
and command you, that you hearken to no Treaty but by my Advice;
which if you follow, you shall have the Benefit of the great
Chain of Friendship between the great King of <i>England</i> and the
King of <i>France</i>, which came out of <i>England</i> the other Day, and
which I have sent to <i>Canada</i> by <i>Anthony le Junard</i>. In the
mean Time, I will give you such Advice as will be for your good;
and will supply you with such Necessaries, as you will have Need
of.</p>

<p>"<i>First</i>, My Advice is, as to what Prisoners of the <i>French</i> you
shall take, that you draw not their Blood, but bring them Home,
and keep them to exchange for your People, which they have
Prisoners already, or may take hereafter.</p>

<p>"<i>2dly</i>, That if it be possible, that you can order it so, I
would have you take one or two of your wisest <i>Sachems</i>, and one
or two of your <i>chief Captains</i>, of each Nation, to be a Council
to manage all Affairs of the War. They to give Orders to the
rest of the Officers what they are to do, that your Designs may
be kept private; for after it comes among so many People, it is
blazed abroad, and your Designs are often frustrated; and those
chief Men should keep a Correspondence with me by a trusty
Messenger.</p>

<p>"<i>3dly</i>, The great Matter under Consideration with the Brethren
is, how to strengthen themselves, and weaken their Enemy. My
Opinion is, that the Brethren should send Messengers to the
<i>Utawawas</i>, <i>Twihtwies</i>, and the <i>farther Indians</i>, and to send
back likewise some of the Prisoners of these Nations, if you
have any left, to bury the Hatchet, and to make a
Covenant-chain, that they may put away all the <i>French</i> that are
among them, and that you will open a Path for them this Way,
they being the King of <i>England</i>'s Subjects likewise, tho' the
French have been admitted to trade with them; for all that the
<i>French</i> have in <i>Canada</i>, they had it of the great King of
<i>England</i>; that by that Means they may come hither freely, where
they may have every Thing cheaper than among the <i>French</i>: That
you and they may join together against the <i>French</i>, and make so
firm a League, that whoever is an Enemy to one, must be to both.</p>

<p>"<i>4thly</i>, Another Thing of Concern is, that you ought to do what
you can to open a Path for all the <i>North Indians</i> and
<i>Mahikanders</i>, that are among the <i>Utawawas</i> and further
Nations: I will endeavour to do the same to bring them Home;
for, they not daring to return Home your Way, the <i>French</i> keep
them there on purpose to join with the other Nations against
you, for your Destruction; for you know, that one of them is
worse than six of the others; therefore all Means must be used
to bring them Home, and use them kindly as they pass through
your Country.</p>

<p>"<i>5thly</i>, My Advice further is, that Messengers go, in behalf of
all the <i>Five Nations</i>, to the <i>Christian Indians</i> at <i>Canada</i>,
to persuade them to come Home to their native Country. This will
be another great Means to weaken your Enemy; but if they will
not be advised, you know what to do with them.</p>

<p>"<i>6thly</i>, I think it very necessary, for the Brethren's Security
and Assistance, and to the endamaging the <i>French</i>, to build a
Fort upon the Lake, where I may keep Stores and Provisions, in
Case of Necessity; and therefore I would have the Brethren let
me know what Place will be most convenient for it.</p>

<p>"<i>7thly</i>, I would not have the Brethren keep their Corn in their
Castles, as I hear the <i>Onondagas</i> do, but bury it a great Way
in the Woods, where few People may know where it is, for fear of
such an Accident as has happened to the <i>Senekas</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>8thly</i>, I have given my Advice in your General Assembly by Mr.
<i>Dirk Wessels</i>, and <i>Akus</i> the Interpreter, how you are to
manage your Parties, and how necessary it is to get Prisoners,
to exchange for your own Men that are Prisoners with the
<i>French</i>; and I am glad to hear that the Brethren are so united,
as Mr. <i>Dirk Wessels</i> tells me you are, and that there are no
rotten Members nor <i>French</i> Spies among you.</p>

<p>"<i>9thly</i>, The Brethren may remember my Advice, which I sent you
this Spring, not to go to <i>Cadarackui</i>; if you had, they would
have served you as they did your People that came from hunting
thither; for I told you then, that I knew the <i>French</i> better
than you did.</p>

<p>"<i>10thly</i>, There was no Advice or Proposition that I made to the
Brethren, all the Time that the Priest lived at <i>Onondaga</i>, but
what he wrote to <i>Canada</i>, as I found by one of his Letters,
which he gave to an <i>Indian</i> to carry to <i>Canada</i>, but which was
brought hither; therefore I desire the Brethren not to receive
him or any <i>French Priest</i> any more, having sent for <i>English
Priests</i>, with whom you may be supplied to your Content.</p>

<p>"<i>11thly</i>, I would have the Brethren look out sharp, for Fear of
being surprized. I believe all the Strength of the <i>French</i> will
be at their Frontier Places, <i>viz</i>. at <i>Cadarackui</i> and
<i>Oniagara</i>, where they have built a Fort now, and at <i>Trois
Rivieres</i>, <i>Montreal</i>, and <i>Chambly</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>12thly</i>, Let me put you in Mind again, not to make any
Treaties without my Means, which will be more advantageous for
you, than your doing it by yourselves, for then you will be
looked upon as the King of <i>England</i>'s Subjects, and let me
know, from Time to Time, every Thing that is done.</p>

<p>"Thus far I have spoken to you relating to the War."</p></div>

<p>Then he chid them for their Breach of Faith with <i>Virginia</i>. He told
them, that he was informed, that last Spring they had killed a fine
Gentleman, with some others; and that a Party of the <i>Oneydoes</i> was now
there at the Head of <i>Tames River</i>, with Intention to destroy all the
<i>Indians</i> thereabout. They had taken six Prisoners, whom he ordered them
to bring to him, to be restored; and that for the future they should
desist from doing any Injury to the People of <i>Virginia</i>, or their
<i>Indians</i>, otherwise all the <i>English</i> would unite to destroy them. But
at the same time he freed the <i>Senekas</i> from any Blame, and commended
them as a brave and honest People, who never had done any Thing contrary
to his Orders, except in making that unlucky Peace with the <i>French</i>,
three Years ago.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, He recommended to them, not to suffer their People to be drunk
during the War: A Soldier thereby (he said) loses his Reputation,
because of the Advantages it will give the Enemy over him.</p>

<p>This honest Gentleman earnestly pursued the Interest of his Country; but
it seems his Measures were not agreeable to those his Master had taken
with the <i>French</i> King; for he had Orders to procure a Peace for the
<i>French</i> on their own Terms, and was soon after this removed from his
Government. Indeed such an active, as well as prudent Governor of
<i>New-York</i>, could not be acceptable to the <i>French</i>, who had the
universal Monarchy in View, in <i>America</i> as well as in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>The great Dispute between Coll. <i>Dungan</i> and the <i>French</i> was in this,
that Coll. <i>Dungan</i> would force the <i>French</i> to apply to him, in all
Affairs relating to the <i>Five Nations</i>, and the <i>French</i> would treat
with them independently of the <i>English</i>. For this Reason Coll. <i>Dungan</i>
refused any Assistance to the <i>French</i>, till they, by such Application,
should acknowledge the Dependance of the <i>Five Nations</i> on the Crown of
<i>England</i>. But King <i>James</i> ordered him to give up this Point; and that
he should persuade the <i>Five Nations</i> to send to <i>Canada</i>, to receive
Proposals from the <i>French Governor</i>; and for this Purpose, forced them
to agree to a Cessation of Arms, till their Deputies should go and
return from <i>Canada</i>; and that they should, in the mean Time, deliver up
all the Prisoners they had taken from the <i>French</i>; and that no Accident
might prevent this, and blast so favourable an Opportunity of making
Peace to the best Advantage, Monsr. <i>De Nonville</i> sent his Orders to all
his Officers in the <i>Indian</i> Countries, to observe a Cessation of Arms,
till the Ambassador of the <i>Five Nations</i> should meet him at <i>Montreal</i>,
as they had given him Reason to expect they would in a little Time, to
conclude the Peace in the usual Form.</p>

<p>In the mean Time, <i>Adario</i>, the Chief of the <i>Deonondadies</i>, finding
that his Nation was become suspected by the <i>French</i>, since the Time
they had shewn so much Inclination to the <i>English</i>, when they attempted
to trade at <i>Missilimakinak</i>, resolved, by some notable Action against
the <i>Five Nations</i>, to recover the good Graces of the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>For this Purpose, he marched from <i>Missilimakinak</i>, at the Head of a
Hundred Men; and that he might act with the more Security, he took
<i>Cadarackui</i> Fort in his Way for Intelligence: The Commandant informed
him, that Monsr. <i>De Nonville</i> was in Hopes of concluding a Peace with
the <i>Five Nations</i>, and expected their Ambassadors in eight or ten Days
at <i>Montreal</i> for that Purpose, and therefore desired him to return to
<i>Missilimakinak</i>, without attempting any Thing that might obstruct so
good a Design.</p>

<p>The <i>Indian</i> being surprised with this News, was under great Concern for
his Nation, which he was afraid would be sacrificed to the <i>French</i>
Interest, but dissembled his Concern before the <i>French</i> Officer. He
went from <i>Cadarackui</i>, not to return home as the Commandant thought,
but to wait for the Ambassadors of the <i>Five Nations</i>, near one of the
Falls of <i>Cadarackui</i> River, by which he knew they must pass. He did not
lurk there above four or five Days, before the Deputies came guarded by
forty young Soldiers, who were all surprised, and killed or taken
Prisoners. As soon as the Prisoners were all secured, the cunning
<i>Deonondadi</i> told them, "That he having been informed, by the Governor
of <i>Canada</i>, that fifty Warriors of their Nation were to pass this Way
about this Time, he had secured this Pass, not doubting of intercepting
them."</p>

<p>The Ambassadors being much surprised at the <i>French</i> Perfidy, told
<i>Adario</i> the Design of their Journey, who, the better to play his Part,
seemed to grow mad and furious, declaring against Monsr. <i>De Nonville</i>,
and said he would, some time or other, be revenged of him, for making a
Tool of him, to commit such horrid Treachery. Then looking stedfastly on
the Prisoners (among whom <i>Dekanefora</i> was the principal Ambassador)
<i>Adario</i> said to them, Go, my Brethren, I unty your Bonds, and send you
home again, tho' our Nations be at War: The <i>French</i> Governor has made
me commit so black an Action, that I shall never be easy after it, till
the <i>Five Nations</i> shall have taken full Revenge.</p>

<p>This was sufficient to persuade the Ambassadors of the Truth of what he
said, who assured him, that he and his Nation might make their Peace
when they pleased. <i>Adario</i> lost only one Man on this Occasion, and
would keep a <i>Satana</i> Prisoner (adopted into the <i>Five Nations</i>) to fill
up his Place. Then he gave Arms, Powder and Ball to the rest of the
Prisoners, to enable them to return.</p>

<p>The Ambassadors were chiefly, if not all, <i>Onondagas</i>, and <i>Oneydoes</i>,
who had been long under the Influence of the <i>French</i> Priests, and still
retained an Affection to them; but this Adventure thoroughly changed
their Thoughts, and irritated them so heartily against the <i>French</i>,
that all the <i>Five Nations</i> prosecuted the War unanimously.</p>

<p><i>Adario</i> delivered the Slave (his Prisoner) to the <i>French</i> at
<i>Missilimakinak</i>, who to keep up the Enmity between the <i>Deonondadies</i>
and the <i>Five Nations</i>, ordered him to be shot to Death. <i>Adario</i>
called one of the <i>Five Nations</i>, who had been long a Prisoner, to be an
Eye Witness of his Countryman's Death, then bid him make his Escape to
his own Country, to give an Account of the <i>French</i> Cruelty, from which
it was not in his Power to save a Prisoner, he himself had taken.</p>

<p>This heightned the Rage of the <i>Five Nations</i> so, that Monsr. <i>De
Nonville</i>'s sending to disown <i>Adario</i> in this Action, had no Effect
upon them; their Breasts admitted of no Thoughts but that of Revenge. It
was not long before the <i>French</i> felt the bloody Effects of this cruel
Passion, for 1200 Men of the <i>Five Nations</i> invaded the Island of
<i>Montreal</i>, when the <i>French</i> had no Suspicion of any such Attempt,
while Monsr. <i>De Nonville</i> and his Lady were in that Town. They landed
on the South Side of the Island, at <i>La Chine</i>, on the 26th of <i>July</i>
1688, where they burnt and sacked all the Plantations, and made a
terrible Massacre of Men, Women, and Children. The <i>French</i> were under
Apprehension of the Town's being attack'd, for which Reason, they durst
not send out any considerable Party to the Relief of the Country, only
once, when the <i>Indians</i> had blocked up two Forts, Monsr. <i>De Nonville</i>
sent out a hundred Soldiers, and fifty <i>Indians</i>, to try to bring off
the Men in those Forts. The <i>French</i> of this Party were all either taken
or cut to Pieces, except one Soldier, and the commanding Officer, who,
after he had his Thighs broke, was carried off by twelve <i>Indians</i> that
made their Escape. There were above a Thousand of the <i>French</i> killed at
this Time, and twenty-six were carried away Prisoners, the greatest Part
of which were burnt alive. The <i>Five Nations</i> only lost three Men on
this Expedition, that got drunk and were left behind. This, however, did
not satiate their Thirst after Blood, for, in <i>October</i> following, they
destroyed likewise all the lower Part of the Island, and carried away
many Prisoners.</p>

<p>The Consequence of these Expeditions were very dismal to the <i>French</i>,
for they were forced to burn their two Barks, which they had on
<i>Cadarackui</i> Lake, and to abandon their Fort there; they designed to
have blown up their Works, when they left that Place; and for that End
left a lighted Match where the Powder lay, but were in such a Fright,
that they durst not stay to see what Effect it had. They went down
<i>Cadarackui</i> River in seven Birch Canoes; and for greater Security,
travelled in the Night. One of the Canoes, with all the Men in it, were
lost, by their Precipitation, as they passed one of the Falls in that
River. The <i>Five Nations</i> hearing the <i>French</i> had deserted <i>Cadarackui</i>
Fort, fifty <i>Indians</i> went and took Possession of it, who found the
Match the <i>French</i> had left, which had gone out, and twenty eight
Barrels of Powder in the same Place, together with several other Stores.</p>

<p>The News of the Success the <i>Five Nations</i> had over the <i>French</i> soon
spread itself among all the <i>Indians</i>, and put the <i>French</i> Affairs
every where into the greatest Disorder.</p>

<p>The <i>Utawawas</i> had always shewn an Inclination to the <i>English</i>, and
they therefore immediately sent openly four <i>Sachems</i>, with three
Prisoners of the <i>Senekas</i>, which they had, to assure them, that they
would for ever renounce all Friendship with the <i>French</i>, and promised
to restore the rest of the Prisoners. They also included seven Nations,
that lived near <i>Missilimakinak</i>, in this Peace.</p>

<p>This put the <i>French</i> Commandant there under the greatest Difficulty to
maintain his Post; but there was no Choice, he must stand his Ground,
for the <i>Five Nations</i> had cut off all Hopes of retiring.</p>

<p>The <i>Nepairinians</i> and <i>Kikabous</i>, of all their numerous Allies, only
remained firm to the <i>French</i>; every one of the others endeavoured to
gain the Friendship of the <i>Five Nations</i>; and would certainly have
done it, by murdering all the <i>French</i> among them, had not the Sieur
<i>Perot</i>, with wonderful Sagacity and eminent Hazard to his own Person,
diverted them.</p>

<p><i>Canada</i> was now in a most miserable Condition, for while the greatest
Number of their Men had been employed in the Expedition against the
<i>Five Nations</i>, and in trading among the far Nations, and making new
Discoveries and Settlements, Tillage and Husbandry had been neglected;
and they lost several Thousands of their Inhabitants, by the continual
Incursions of small Parties, so that none durst hazard themselves out of
fortified Places; indeed, it is hard to conceive what Distress the
<i>French</i> were then under, for tho' they were every where almost
starving, they could not plant nor sow, or go from one Village to
another for Relief, but with imminent Danger of having their Scalps
carried away by the sculking <i>Indians</i>; at last the whole Country being
laid waste, Famine began to rage, and was like to have put a miserable
End to that Colony.</p>

<p>If the <i>Indians</i> had understood the Method of attacking Forts, nothing
could have preserved the <i>French</i> from an entire Destruction at this
Time; for whoever considers the State of the <i>Indian</i> Affairs during
this Period, how the <i>Five Nations</i> were divided in their Sentiments and
Measures; that the <i>Onondagas</i>, <i>Cayugas</i>, and <i>Oneydoes</i>, under the
Influence of the <i>French</i> Jesuites, were diverted from prosecuting the
War against <i>Canada</i>, by the Jesuites cunningly spiriting up those three
Nations against the <i>Virginia Indians</i>, and persuading them to send out
their Parties that Way: That the <i>Senekas</i> had a War at the same Time
upon their Hands with three numerous <i>Indian</i> Nations, the <i>Utawawas</i>,
<i>Chicktaghicks</i>, and <i>Twihtwies</i>; and that the Measures the <i>English</i>
observed all King <i>James</i>'s Reign, gave the <i>Indians</i> rather Grounds of
Jealousy than Assistance: I say, whoever considers all these Things, and
what the <i>Five Nations</i> did actually perform, under all these
Disadvantages against the <i>French</i>, will hardly doubt, that the <i>Five
Nations</i> by themselves were at that Time an Overmatch for the <i>French</i>
of <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">T</span>he former Part of this History was written at</i> New-York <i>in the Year</i>
1727, <i>on Occasion of a Dispute which then happened, between the
Government of</i> New-York <i>and some</i> Merchants. <i>The</i> French <i>of</i> Canada <i>had the
whole Fur Trade with the</i> Western Indians <i>in their Hands, and were
supplied with their woollen Goods from</i> New-York. <i>Mr.</i> Burnet, <i>who took
more Pains to be informed of the Interest of the People he was set over,
and of making them useful to their Mother Country, than Plantation
Governors usually do, took the Trouble of perusing all the Registers of
the</i> Indian <i>Affairs on this Occasion. He from thence conceived of what
Consequence the Fur Trade with the</i> Western Indians <i>was of to</i>
Great-Britain; <i>that as the</i> English <i>had the Fur Trade to</i> Hudson's Bay
<i>given up to them, by the Treaty of</i> Utrecht, <i>so, by the Advantages which
the Province of</i> New-York <i>has in its Situation, they might be able to
draw the whole Fur Trade in the other Parts of</i> America <i>to themselves,
and thereby the</i> English <i>engross that Trade, and the Manufactories
depending on it</i>.</p>

<p><i>For this Purpose he thought it necessary to put a Stop to the Trade
between</i> New-York <i>and</i> Canada, <i>by which the</i> French <i>supplied themselves
with the most valuable and necessary Commodities for the</i> Indian <i>Market,
and to set the Inhabitants of this Province on trading directly with the</i>
Indians. <i>Besides the Consideration of Profit and Gain, he considered
what Influence this Trade had on the numerous Nations of</i> Indians <i>living
on the vast Continent of</i> North-America, <i>and who surround the</i> British
<i>Colonies; of what Advantage it might be of, if they were influenced by
the</i> English <i>in Case of a War with</i> France; <i>and how prejudicial, on the
other Hand, if they were directed by</i> French <i>Counsels</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Legislature of</i> New-York <i>was soon convinced of the Justness of his
Reasoning, and passed an Act, prohibiting the Trade to</i> Canada, <i>and for
encouraging the Trade directly with the</i> Indians. <i>They were likewise at
the Charge of building a fortified trading House at</i> Oswego, <i>on</i>
Cadarackui Lake, <i>and have ever since maintained a Garison there. As this
Act did in its Consequence take a large Profit from one or two
considerable Merchants, who had the Trade to</i> Canada, <i>intirely in their
Hands, they endeavoured to raise a Clamour against it in the Province,
and presented likewise Petitions to the King, in Order to get the Act
repealed. Upon this Occasion Mr.</i> Burnet <i>gave me the Perusal of the
Publick Register of</i> Indian <i>Affairs, and it was thought the Publication
of the History of the</i> Five Nations <i>might be of Use at that Time</i>.</p>

<p><i>I shall only add, that Mr.</i> Burnet's <i>Scheme has had its desired Effect:
The</i> English <i>have gained the Trade which the</i> French, <i>before that, had
with the</i> Indians <i>to the Westward of</i> New-York; <i>and whereas, before that
Time, a very inconsiderable Number of Men were employed in the</i> Indian
<i>Trade Abroad, now above three hundred Men are employed at the Trading
House at</i> Oswego <i>alone; and the</i> Indian <i>Trade has since that Time yearly
increased so far, that several</i> Indian <i>Nations come now every Summer to
trade there, whose Names were not so much as known by the</i> English
<i>before</i>.</p>

<p><i>This History, from</i> New-York, <i>soon went to</i> England, <i>and I have been
informed, that a Publication, with a Continuance of that Work, would be
acceptable there. I have the more chearfully complied with this Notice,
because of the War threatened from</i> France, <i>believing that a Publication
of this Kind may be useful, whether the present Inquietudes between the
two Nations end in a War or in a Treaty. The</i> French <i>have encouraged
several Publications of this Sort at</i> Paris, <i>and certainly such may be
more useful in a</i> British <i>Government, where the People have so great a
Share in it, than it can be in a</i> French <i>Government, intirely directed by
the Will of their Prince</i>.</p>

<p><i>I now continue this History to the Peace of</i> Reswick, <i>and if I find this
acceptable, and that a farther Continuation of it be desired, I shall,
if my Life and Health be preserved, carry it down farther; but as I have
too much Reason to doubt my own Ability, to give that Pleasure and
Satisfaction which the Publick may expect in Things thus submitted to
their View, I think it not justifiable to trouble them with too much at
once</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAP. I.</h2>

<h4><i>The State of Affairs in</i> New-York <i>and</i> Canada, <i>at the Time of the</i>
Revolution <i>in</i> Great-Britain.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e left the <i>Five Nations</i> triumphing over the <i>French</i> in <i>Canada</i>, and
they almost reduced to Despair. The Revolution, which happened at this
Time in <i>England</i>, seemed to be a favourable Conjunction for the <i>Five
Nations</i>; the <i>English</i> Colonies, by the War at that Time declared
against <i>France</i>, becoming Parties in their Quarrel: For one will be
ready to think, that the <i>Five Nations</i> being by themselves too powerful
for the <i>French</i>, as appears by the preceding Chapter, when these were
assisted by the <i>Utawawas</i>, <i>Quatoghies</i>, <i>Twihtwies</i>, <i>Chictaghicks</i>,
<i>Putewatemies</i>, and all the <i>Western Indian Nations</i>, and when the
<i>English</i> stood neuter; now certainly, when not only all these <i>Indian
Nations</i> had made Peace with the <i>Five Nations</i>, but the <i>English</i>
joined with them in the War, the <i>French</i> would not be able to stand one
Campaign.</p>

<p>But we shall find what a Turn Affairs took, contrary to all reasonable
Expectations, from the general Appearance of Things, and of what
Importance a resolute wise Governor is to the well-being of a People,
and how prejudicial Divisions and Parties are. For this Reason, it will
be necessary to take a View of the Publick Affairs in the Province of
<i>New-York</i>, and in <i>Canada</i>, at that Time, in order to understand the
true Causes of the Alterations, which afterwards happened in Favour of
the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>The Revolution occasioned as great Divisions and Parties in the Province
of <i>New-York</i>, in Proportion to the Number of People, as it did in
<i>Britain</i>, if not greater. The Governor and all the Officers either fled
or absconded; the Gentlemen of the King's Council, and some of the most
considerable or richest People, either out of Love, or what they thought
Duty, to King <i>James</i>, or rather from an Opinion they had that the
<i>Prince of Orange</i> could not succeed, refused to join in the Declaration
the People made in favour of that Prince, and suffered the
Administration to fall into different Hands, who were more zealous for
the Protestant Interest, and who were joined by the far greatest Number
of the Inhabitants. After the Revolution was established, they that had
appeared so warmly for it, thought that they deserved best of the
Government, and expected to be continued in the Publick Offices; the
others were zealous to recover the Authority they had lost, and used the
most persuasive Means with the Governors for that Purpose, while the
former trusted to their Merit. This begat great Animosities, which
continued many Years. Each Party, as they were at different Times
favoured by several Governors, opposed all the Measures taken by the
other, while each of them were by Turns in Credit with the People or the
Governor, and sometimes even prosecuted each other to Death. The publick
Measures were by these Means perpetually fluctuating, and often one Day
contradictory to what they were the Day before. The succeeding
Governors, finding their private Account in favouring sometimes the one
Party, and at other Times the other, kept up the Animosities all King
<i>William</i>'s Reign, though very much to the publick Prejudice; for each
Party was this while so eager in resenting private Injuries, that they
intirely neglected the publick Good.</p>

<p>The Constitution of Government in the <i>English Plantations</i>, where the
Governors have no Salary, but what they can attain with the Consent of
the Assemblies or Representatives of the People, gave Occasion to
imprudent Governors to fall upon these Expedients, as they sometimes
call them, for getting of Money. And a prevailing Faction, knowing for
what Purpose the Governments in <i>America</i> were chiefly desired by the
<i>English</i> Gentlemen, used this great Privilege to tempt a Governor to be
the Head of a Party, when he ought to have been the Head of the
Government. Indeed <i>New-York</i> has had the Misfortune, too frequently, to
be under such as could not keep their Passion for Money secret, though
none found it so profitable a Government, as they did who followed
strictly the true Maxims of governing, without making Money the only
Rule of their Actions.</p>

<p>The frequent Changes of Governors were likewise prejudicial to the
publick Affairs. Colonel <i>Slaughter</i>, the first Governor after the
Revolution, happened to die soon after his Arrival, when steady, as well
as resolute Measures, were most necessary. But some think, that the
Occasion of all the Misfortunes lay in the Want of Care in the Choice of
Governors, when the Affairs of <i>America</i> wanted able Hands to manage
them; they think that the Ministry had the saving of Money chiefly in
View, when, to gratify some small Services, they gave Employments in
<i>America</i> to those that were not capable of much meaner Offices at Home.
The Opinion the People had of Colonel <i>Slaughter</i>'s Capacity gave ground
to these Surmises; but, if it was so, it happened to be very ill saved
Money; for the Mismanagements in this Country occasioned far greater
Expence to the Crown afterwards, than would have bought such Gentlemen
handsome Estates, besides the great Losses they occasioned to the
Subjects.</p>

<p>The greatest Number of the Inhabitants of the Province of <i>New-York</i>
being <i>Dutch</i>, still retained an Affection to their Mother Country, and
by their Aversion to the <i>English</i> weakened the Administration. The
common People of <i>Albany</i>, who are all <i>Dutch</i>, could not forbear giving
the <i>Indians</i> some ill Impressions of the <i>English</i>; for the <i>Mohawks</i>,
in one of their publick Speeches, expressed themselves thus: "We hear a
<i>Dutch Prince</i> reigns now in <i>England</i>, why do you suffer the <i>English</i>
Soldiers to remain in the Fort? put all the <i>English</i> out of the Town.
When the <i>Dutch</i> held this Country long ago, we lay in their Houses; but
the <i>English</i> have always made us lie without Doors." It is true, that
the Plantations were first settled by the meanest People of every
Nation, and such as had the least Sense of any Honour. The <i>Dutch</i> first
Settlers, many of them I may say, had none of the Virtues of their
Countrymen, except their Industry in getting Money, and they sacrificed
every Thing, other People think honourable or most sacred, to their
Gain: But I do not think it proper to give particular Instances of this.</p>

<p>The People of <i>New-England</i> were engaged in a bloody War at this Time
with the <i>Owenagungas</i>, <i>Ouragies</i>, and <i>Ponacoks</i>, the <i>Indians</i> that
lie between them and the <i>French</i> Settlements. The <i>Scahkooks</i> were
originally Part of these <i>Indians</i>. They left their Country about the
Year 1672, and settled above <i>Albany</i>, on the Branch of <i>Hudson's River</i>
that runs towards <i>Canada</i>. The People of <i>New-England</i> were jealous of
the <i>Scahkook Indians</i>, that they remembering the old Difference they
had with the People of <i>New England</i>, and the Relation they bore to the
<i>Eastern Indians</i>, did countenance and assist these <i>Indians</i> in the War
against <i>New England</i>. They had Reason for these Jealousies, for the
<i>Scahkook Indians</i> received privately some <i>Owenagunga</i> Messengers, and
kept their coming among them secret from the People of <i>Albany</i>; and
some <i>Scahkooks</i> had gone privately to the <i>Owenagungas</i>. They were
afraid likewise, that the <i>Mohawks</i> might have some Inclination to
favour those <i>Indians</i>, because some of the <i>Eastern Indians</i> had fled
to the <i>Mohawks</i>, and were kindly received by them, and lived among
them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these Failures of good Policy, in the Government of
<i>New-York</i>, the <i>French</i> had not gained so great Advantages, if they had
not carefully observed a different Conduct, which it is now necessary to
consider.</p>

<p><i>Canada</i> was at this Time in a very distressed Condition, the Country
and out Plantations burnt and destroyed, their Trade intirely at a
stand, great Numbers of their People slain, and the remainder in danger
of perishing by Famine, as well as by the Sword of inveterate cruel
Enemies. When such Misfortunes happen to a Country, under any
Administration, though in Truth the Conduct of Affairs be not to be
blamed, it is often prudent to change the Ministers; for the common
People never fail to blame them, notwithstanding their having acted with
the greatest Wisdom, and therefore cannot so soon recover their Spirits,
that are sunk by Misfortunes, as by putting their Affairs into different
Hands.</p>

<p>For these Reasons, it is probable, the <i>French</i> King recalled Mr. <i>de
Nonville</i>, but rewarded him for his Services, by an honourable
Employment in the Houshold. The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> was sent in his
Place. This Gentleman had been formerly Governor of that Country, and
was perfectly acquainted with its Interest; of a Temper of Mind fitted
to such desperate Times, of undaunted Courage, and indefatigable, though
in the sixty-eighth Year of his Age. The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> arrived
the second of <i>October</i> 1689. The Country immediately received new Life
by the Arrival of a Person, of whose Courage and Conduct every one had
entertained a high Opinion. Care was taken to increase this Impression
on the Minds of the People, by making publick Rejoicings with as much
Noise as possible. He wisely improved this new Life, by immediately
entering upon Action, without suffering their Hopes to grow cold. He
staid no longer at <i>Quebeck</i>, than was necessary to be informed of the
present State of Affairs, and in four or five Days after his Arrival set
out in a Canoe for <i>Montreal</i>, where his Presence was most necessary;
and the Winter was already so far advanced, that the Ice made it
impracticable to go in a larger Vessel. By this the old Gentleman
increased the Opinion and Hopes the People entertained of him, that,
without staying to refresh himself after a fatiguing Sea-Voyage, he
would immediately undertake another, that required all the Vigour and
Heat of Youth to withstand the Inclemencies of the Climate and Season,
and the Difficulty of such a Passage.</p>

<p>When the Count <i>de Frontenac</i> came to <i>Montreal</i>, he increased the
Admiration the People had of his Vigour and Zeal, by pretending to go to
visit <i>Cadarackui Fort</i>, now abandoned, which he had built in the Time
he was formerly Governor. The Clergy and People of <i>Montreal</i> came
jointly with stretched out Arms, representing the Danger of such an
Attempt, and the Difficulties and Hardships that would necessarily
attend it, praying him not to expose a Life that was so necessary for
their Safety. He, with seeming Reluctance, yielded to their Intreaties;
I say with seeming Reluctance, for it was inconsistent with his Prudence
really to have such a Design. This Shew of the Governor's offering to go
in Person, animated some of the Gentlemen of the Country, who
voluntarily went in the Winter, with one Hundred <i>Indian</i> Traders, to
visit that Fort; and finding it in better Condition than they expected,
by the Report of those who had abandoned it, they staid there, and made
some small Reparations in the Walls, which the <i>Indians</i> had thrown
down.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> brought back with him <i>Tawerahet</i>, a <i>Capiga
Sachem</i>, one of the thirteen Prisoners that Mr. <i>de Nonville</i> took at
<i>Cadarackui</i>, and sent to <i>France</i>. He was in Hopes this <i>Indian</i> would
be useful in procuring a Treaty of Peace with the <i>Five Nations</i>, for
they had an extraordinary Opinion of <i>Tawerahet</i>; and the <i>French</i> had
found, by sad Experience, that they could not be Gainers by continuing
the War: For this Purpose the Count used <i>Tawerahet</i> with much
Kindness, during his Voyage, and, after he arrived at <i>Quebeck</i>, lodged
him in the Castle under his own Roof, and took such Pains with this
<i>Sachem</i>, that he forgot all the ill Usage he had formerly received.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> had the more Reason to desire a Peace with the <i>Five
Nations</i>, because they knew, that they would now certainly have the
<i>English</i> Colonies likewise upon them; and if the <i>Five Nations</i> had
been able to do so much Mischief by themselves alone, they were much
more to be feared, when they would be assisted, in all Probability, with
the Force and Interest of the <i>English</i> Colonies.</p>

<p>Four <i>Indians</i> of less Note, who were brought back along with
<i>Tawerahet</i>, were immediately dispatched, in this <i>Sachem</i>'s Name, to
the <i>Five Nations</i>, to inform them of his Return, and of the kind Usage
they had received from the Count <i>de Frontenac</i>; and to press them to
send some to visit their old Friend, who had been so kind to them when
he was formerly Governor of <i>Canada</i>, and who still retained an
Affection to the <i>Five Nations</i>; as appeared by the Kindness <i>Tawerahet</i>
and they had received from him. This was the only Method left to the
<i>French</i> of making Proposals of Peace, which it was their Interest by
all Means to procure.</p>

<p>The Governor of <i>Canada</i>, as I said, conceived that there was no Way so
proper to keep up the Spirits of the People, who had got new Life by his
Arrival, as by putting them upon Action; and indeed their present
miserable Condition made them forward enough, to undertake the most
desperate Enterprize, when the frequent Incursions of the <i>Indians</i> made
it as dangerous to be at Home, as to attack the Enemy Abroad.</p>

<p>For this Purpose he sent out three Parties in the Winter; one was
designed against <i>New-York</i>, the other against <i>Connecticut</i>, and the
last against <i>New-England</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> followed Colonel <i>Dungan</i>'s Advice, in endeavouring
to bring off the <i>Western Indians</i> from the <i>French</i>, and had all the
Success that could be expected, before Mr. <i>de Frontenac</i> arrived.</p>

<p>They were overjoyed when they heard, that the <i>English</i> had entered into
War with the <i>French</i>, and came several Times to <i>Albany</i> to know the
Certainty of it, while it was only rumoured about. The People of
<i>Albany</i> desired them to secure any of the praying <i>Indians</i> that should
come from <i>Canada</i>, if they found that they were still ruled by the
Priests; but to encourage them, if they came with a Design to return to
their own Country.</p>

<p>The <i>Senekas, Cayugas, Onondagas</i>, and <i>Oneydoes</i>, the twenty seventh of
<i>June</i> 1689, before any Governor arrived, renewed the old Covenant (as
they said) which was first made many Years ago with one <i>Tagues</i>, who
came with a Ship into their River. "Then we first became Brethren, said
they, and continued so till last fall, that Sir <i>Edmond Andross</i> came
and made a new Chain, by calling us Children; but let us stick to the
old Chain, which has continued from the first Time it was made, by which
we became Brethren, and have ever since always behaved as such.
<i>Virginia, Maryland</i>, and <i>New-England</i>, have been taken into this
silver Chain, with which our Friendship is locked fast. We are now come
to make the Chain clear and bright. Here they <b>gave two Bevers</b>."</p>

<p>King <i>James</i>, a little before his Abdication, sent over Sir <i>Edmond
Andross</i> with arbitrary Powers, and he, in Imitation of the <i>French</i>,
changed the Stile of speaking to the <i>Indians</i>, of which they were very
sensible.</p>

<p>They discovered a great Concern for their People that were carried to
<i>Canada</i>; they long hoped (they said) that the King of <i>England</i> would
have been powerful enough to deliver them, but now they began to lose
all Hopes of them.</p>

<h4><i>A Treaty between the Agents of</i> Massachuset's Bay, New-Plymouth, <i>and</i>
Connecticut, <i>and the</i> Sachems <i>of the</i> Five Nations, <i>at</i> Albany, <i>in
the Year</i> 1689.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>bout the Beginning of <i>September</i> 1689, Colonel <i>John Pynchon</i>, Major
<i>John Savage</i>, and Captain <i>Jonathan Bull</i>, Agents for the Colonies of
<i>Massachuset's Bay, New-Plymouth</i>, and <i>Connecticut</i>, arrived at
<i>Albany</i>, to renew the Friendship with the <i>Five Nations</i>, and to engage
them against the <i>Eastern Indians</i>, who made War on the <i>English</i> of
those Colonies, and were supported by the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> had received four Messengers from the <i>Eastern
Indians</i>, which gave the People of <i>New-England</i> some Apprehensions, and
they were therefore desirous to know what Reception these Messengers had
met with.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> answered by <i>Tahajadoris</i>, a <i>Mohawk Sachem</i>, on the
twenty fourth of <i>September</i>. He made a long Oration, repeating all that
the Agent from <i>New-England</i> had said, the Day before, and desired them
to be attentive to the Answer now to be made to them. They commonly
repeat over all that has been said to them, before they return any
Answer, and one may be surprized at the Exactness of these Repetitions.
They take the following Method to assist their Memories: The <i>Sachem</i>,
who presides at these Conferences, has a Bundle of small Sticks in his
Hand; as soon as the Speaker has finished any one Article of his Speech,
this <i>Sachem</i> gives a Stick to another <i>Sachem</i>, who is particularly to
remember that Article; and so when another Article is finished, he gives
a Stick to another to take Care of that other, and so on. In like Manner
when the Speaker answers, each of these has the particular Care of the
Answer resolved on to each Article, and prompts the Orator, when his
Memory fails him, in the Article committed to his Charge. <i>Tahajadoris</i>
addressing himself to the Agents, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Brethren,</p>

<p>"You are welcome to this House, which is appointed for our
Treaties and publick Business with the Christians; we thank you
for renewing the Covenant-chain. It is now no longer of Iron and
subject to Rust, as formerly, but of pure Silver, and includes
in it all the King's Subjects, from the <i>Senekas</i> Country
eastward, as far as any of the great King's Subjects live, and
southward, from <i>New-England</i> to <i>Virginia</i>. Here he <b>gave a
Bever</b>.</p>

<p>"We are glad to hear of the good Success our great King has had
over the <i>French</i> by Sea, in taking and sinking so many of their
Men of War. You tell us in your Proposals that we are one
People, let us then go Hand in Hand together, to ruin and
destroy the <i>French</i> our common Enemy. <b>Gives a Bever.</b></p>

<p>"The Covenant-chain between us is ancient (as you tell us) and
of long standing, and it has been kept inviolably by us. When
you had Wars some time ago with the <i>Indians</i>, you desired us to
help you; we did it readily, and to the Purpose; for we pursued
them closely, by which we prevented the Effusion of much of your
Blood. This was a certain Sign that we loved truly and
sincerely, and from our Hearts. <b>Gives a Belt.</b></p>

<p>"You advise us to pursue our Enemies, the <i>French</i>, vigorously;
this we assure you we are resolved to do to the utmost of our
Power: But since the <i>French</i> are your Enemies likewise, we
desire our Brethren of the three Colonies to send us an hundred
Men for the Security of this Place, which is ill provided, in
Case of an Attack from the <i>French</i>; the Christians have
Victuals enough for their Entertainment. <b>Gives one Belt.</b></p>

<p>"We patiently bore many Injuries from the <i>French</i>, from one
Year to another, before we took up the Axe against them. Our
Patience made the Governor of <i>Canada</i> think, that we were
afraid of him, and durst not resent the Injuries we had so long
suffered; but now he is undeceived. We assure you, that we are
resolved never to drop the Axe, the <i>French</i> never shall see our
Faces in Peace, we shall never be reconciled as long as one
<i>Frenchman</i> is alive. We shall never make Peace, though our
Nation should be ruined by it, and every one of us cut in
Pieces. Our Brethren of the three Colonies may depend on this.
<b>Gives a Bever.</b></p>

<p>"As to what you told us of the <i>Owenagungas</i> and <i>Uragees</i>, we
answer: That we were never so proud and haughty, as to begin a
War without just Provocation. You tell us that they are
treacherous Rogues, we believe it, and that they will
undoubtedly assist the <i>French</i>. If they shall do this, or shall
join with any of our Enemies, either <i>French</i> or <i>Indians</i>, then
we will kill and destroy them. <b>Gives a Bever.</b>"</p></div>

<p>Then the <i>Mohawks</i> offered five of their Men, to guard the Agents Home
against any of their <i>Indian</i> Enemies, who they were afraid might be
laying in wait for the Agents, and <b>gave a Belt</b>.</p>

<p>Afterwards the Speaker continued his Speech, and said: "We have spoke
what we had to say of the War, we now come to the Affairs of Peace: We
promise to preserve the Chain inviolably, and wish that the Sun may
always shine in Peace over all our Heads that are comprehended in this
Chain. We <b>give two Belts</b>, one for the Sun, the other for its Beams."</p>

<p>"We make fast the Roots of the Tree of Peace and Tranquillity, which is
planted in this Place. Its Roots extend as far as the utmost of your
Colonies; if the <i>French</i> should come to shake this Tree, we would feel
it by the Motion of its Roots, which extend into our Country: But we
trust it will not be in the Governor of <i>Canada</i>'s Power to shake this
Tree, which has been so firmly and so long planted with us. <b>Bevers.</b>"</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, He desired the Magistrates of <i>Albany</i> to remember what he had
said, and <b>gave them a Bever</b>.</p>

<p>But the Agents perceiving, that they had not answered any Thing about
the <i>Owenagunga</i> Messengers, and had answered indistinctly about the War
with the <i>Eastern Indians</i>, desired them to explain themselves fully on
these two Points, about which the Agents were chiefly concerned.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> answered:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We cannot declare War against the <i>Eastern Indians</i>, for they
have done us no Harm: Nevertheless our Brethren of <i>New-England</i>
may be assured, that we will live and die in Friendship with
them. When we took up the Axe against the <i>French</i> and their
Confederates, we did it to revenge the Injuries they had done
us; we did not make War with them at the Persuasions of our
Brethren here; for we did not so much as acquaint them with our
Intention, till fourteen Days after our Army had begun their
March."</p></div>

<p>After the Company had separated, the <i>Sachems</i> sent to the <i>New-England</i>
Agents, desiring to speak with them in private; which being granted, the
Speaker said, we have something to tell you, which was not proper to be
spoken openly, for some of our People have an Affection to the
<i>Owenagungas</i>; and we were afraid, that they would discover or hinder
our Designs.</p>

<p>Now we assure our Brethren, that we are resolved to look on your Enemies
as ours, and that we will first fall on the <i>Owaragees</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; and then on
the <i>Owenagungas</i>, and lastly on the <i>French</i>; and that you may be
convinced of our Intention, we design to send five of our young Men
along with our Brethren to <i>New-England</i>, to guard them, who have Orders
to view the Country of the <i>Owaragees</i>, to discover in what Manner it
can be attacked with the most Advantage. This we always do before we
make an Attempt on our Enemies. In a Word, Brethren, your War is our
War, for we will live and dye with you.</p>

<p>But it is to be observed, that they confirmed nothing relating to these
<i>Indians</i>, by giving Belts.</p>

<p>It is probable, that the <i>Sachems</i> acted with some Art on this Occasion,
for they really had favourable Inclinations towards the <i>Owenagungas</i>;
and they had Reason not to increase the Number of their Enemies, by
making War on the <i>Eastern Indians</i>, who avoided doing them any Injury.
The People of <i>Albany</i> likewise have always been averse to engage our
<i>Indians</i> in a War with the <i>Eastern Indians</i>, lest it should change the
Seat of the War, and bring it to their own Doors.</p>

<p>On the 25th the Magistrates of <i>Albany</i> had a private Conference with
the <i>Sachems</i> of the <i>Five Nations</i>, and desired to know their
Resolutions as to the War with <i>Canada</i>, and the Measures they resolved
to follow. In this Conference the <i>Indians</i> saw that the People of
<i>Albany</i> were so much afraid of the <i>French</i>, that their Spirits were
sunk under the Apprehensions of the approaching War; and for this Reason
made the following Answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We have a hundred and forty Men out-skulking about <i>Canada</i>; it
is impossible for the <i>French</i> to attempt any Thing, without
being discovered and harassed by these Parties: If the <i>French</i>
shall attempt any Thing this Way, all the <i>Five Nations</i> will
come to your Assistance, for our Brethren and we are but one,
and we will live and dye together. We have desired a hundred Men
of our Brethren of <i>Boston</i> to assist us here, because this
Place is most exposed; but if the Governor of <i>Canada</i> is so
strong, as to overcome us all united together, then he must be
our Master, and is not to be resisted; but we have Confidence in
a good and just Cause; for the great God of Heaven knows how
deceitfully the <i>French</i> have dealt with us, their Arms can have
no Success. The Great God hath sent us Signs in the Sky to
confirm this. We have heard uncommon Noise in the Heavens, and
have seen Heads fall down upon Earth, which we look upon as a
certain Presage of the Destruction of the <i>French</i>: Take
Courage! On this they all immediately joined in singing and
crying out, Courage! Courage!"</p></div>

<h4><i>An Account of a general Council of the</i> Five Nations <i>at</i> Onondaga, <i>to
consider the Count</i> De Frontenac'<i>s Message</i>.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n the 27th of <i>December</i> 1689, two <i>Indians</i> came to <i>Albany</i>, being
sent by the <i>Onondaga</i> and <i>Oneydo Sachems</i>, with seven Hands of Wampum
from each Nation, to tell their Brethren in <i>New-York</i> and
<i>New-England</i>, that three of their old Friends, who had been carried
Prisoners to <i>France</i>, were come with Proposals from <i>Canada</i>; that
there was a Council of the <i>Sachems</i> appointed to meet at <i>Onondaga</i>,
and that they therefore desired the Mayor of <i>Albany</i>, <i>Peter Scheyler</i>,
and some others of their Brethren, to come thither, to be present and to
advise on an Affair of so great Consequence; for they were resolved to
do nothing without the Knowledge and Consent of all those that were
included in the Chain with them.</p>

<p>The same Messenger told them, that some Letters were sent to the Jesuit
at <i>Oneydo</i>; and that they would neither burn, nor suffer those Letters
to be opened, till the Brethren should first see them.</p>

<p>All that the Magistrates of <i>Albany</i> did on this important Occasion, was
to send three <i>Indians</i> with Instructions in their Name, to dissuade the
<i>Five Nations</i> from entertaining any Thoughts of Peace, or yielding to a
Cessation of Arms.</p>

<p>On the 4th of <i>January</i> one of the chief <i>Mohawk Sachems</i> came to
<i>Albany</i>, to tell the <i>Magistrates</i>, that he was to go to <i>Onondaga</i>,
and desired the Brethren's Advice how to behave there; on which the
Magistrates thought it necessary to send likewise the publick
Interpreter, and another Person to assist at the general Meeting, with
written Instructions; but no Person of Note, that had any Influence on
the <i>Indians</i>, went.</p>

<p>When the Messengers arrived at <i>Oneydo</i>, they discoursed privately with
one of the Prisoners that had returned from <i>France</i>, and found that he
had no Love for the <i>French</i>; but it is impossible but that <i>Indians</i>,
who had seen the <i>French</i> Court, and many of their Troops, must be
surprised at their Grandeur: he complained however of the ill Usage he
had met with. The <i>French</i> chose, on this Occasion, to send first to
<i>Oneydo</i>, because of the Assistance they expected the Jesuit, that
resided there, would give to their Negotiation.</p>

<p>I believe it will not be tedious to the Reader, that desires to know the
<i>Indian Genius</i>, if I give a circumstantial Account of this general
Council or Parliament of the <i>Five Nations</i>, that he may see in what
Manner a People that we call Savages behave on such important Occasions.</p>

<p>On the 22d of <i>January</i> the general Council was opened at <i>Onondaga</i>,
consisting of eighty <i>Sachems</i>; in the first Place <i>Sadekanaghtie</i>, an
<i>Onondaga Sachem</i>, rising up, addressed himself to the Messenger of
<i>Albany</i>, saying,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Four Messengers are come from the Governor of <i>Canada</i>, <i>viz</i>. three who
had been carried Prisoners to <i>France</i>, and a <i>Sachem</i> of the <i>Praying
Indians</i> that live at <i>Montreal</i>.</p>

<p>The Governor of <i>Canada</i> notifies his Arrival to us, that he is the
Count <i>de Frontenac</i>, who had been formerly Governor there; that he had
brought back with him <i>Tawerahet</i> a <i>Cayuga Sachem</i>, and twelve
Prisoners, that had been carried to <i>France</i>; then taking the Belt of
<i>Wampum</i> in his Hand, and holding it by the Middle, he added, what I
have said relates only to one Half of the Belt, the other Half is to let
us know, that he intends to kindle again his Fire at <i>Cadarackui</i> next
Spring, and therefore invites his Children, and <i>Dekanasora</i> an
<i>Onondaga Captain</i> in particular, to treat there with him about the old
Chain. Then <i>Adarahta</i> the chief <i>Sachem</i> of the <i>praying Indians</i> stood
up, and said, with three Belts in his Hand, I advise you to meet the
Governor of <i>Canada</i> as he desires; agree to this, if you would live,
and <b>gives one Belt of <i>Wampum</i></b>.</p>

<p><i>Tawerahet</i> sends you this other Belt, to inform you of the Miseries,
that he and the rest of your Countrymen have suffered in their
Captivity; and to advise you to hearken to <i>Yonondio</i>, if you desire to
live.</p>

<p>This third Belt is from <i>Thurensera</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, <i>Ohguesse</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, and
<i>Ertel</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, who say by it, to their Brethren: We have interceded for
you with <i>Yonondio</i>, and therefore advise you to meet him at
<i>Cadarackui</i> in the Spring, because it will be for your Advantage.</p>
</div>

<p>When this <i>Sachem</i> had done speaking, the <i>Mohawk</i> Messenger sent from
<i>Albany</i> delivered his Message Word for Word, as he had received it,
without omitting the least Article. The Interpreter, while the <i>Indian</i>
was speaking, read over a Paper, on which the Message was set down, lest
any Thing should have been forgot.</p>

<p>After this <i>Cannehoot</i> a <i>Seneka Sachem</i> stood up, and gave the general
Council a particular Account of a Treaty made last Summer, between the
<i>Senekas</i> and the <i>Wagunha</i> Messengers, (one of the <i>Utawawa</i> Nations)
who had concluded a Peace for themselves, and seven other Nations, to
which the other four Nations were desired to agree, and their Brethren
of <i>New-York</i> to be included in it. He said the Proposals made in
several Propositions were as follow.</p>

<p>1. We are come to join two Bodies into one. Delivering up at the same
Time two Prisoners.</p>

<p>2. We are come to learn Wisdom of you <i>Senekas</i>, and of the other <i>Five
Nations</i>, and of your Brethren of <i>New-York</i>. <b>Giving a Belt.</b></p>

<p>3. We by this Belt wipe away the Tears from the Eyes of your Friends,
whose Relations have been killed in the War, and likewise<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the Paint
from your Soldiers Faces. <b>Giving another Belt.</b></p>

<p>4. We now throw aside the Ax, which <i>Yonondio</i> put into our Hands, by
this <b>third Belt</b>.</p>

<p>5. Let the Sun, as long as he shall endure, always shine upon us in
Friendship. Here he <b>gave a red Marble Sun</b> as large as a Plate.</p>

<p>6. Let the Rain of Heaven wash away all Hatred, that we may again smoke
together in Peace, <b>giving a large Pipe</b> of red Marble.</p>

<p>7. <i>Yonondio</i> is drunk, but we wash our Hands clean from all his
Actions. <b>Giving a fourth Belt.</b></p>

<p>8. Now we are clean washed by the Water of Heaven, neither of us must
defile ourselves by hearkening to <i>Yonondio</i>.</p>

<p>9. We have twelve of your Nation Prisoners, who shall be brought home in
the Spring; there he <b>gave a Belt</b>, to confirm the Promise.</p>

<p>10. We will bring your Prisoners when the Strawberries shall be in
blossom,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> at which Time we intend to visit <i>Corlear</i>, and see the
Place where the Wampum is made. (<i>New-York</i>.)</p>

<p>The Speaker added, we will also tell our Friends the other <i>Utawawa</i>
Nations, and the <i>Dionondadies</i>, who have eleven of your People
Prisoners, what we have now done, and invite them to make Peace with
you.</p>

<p>He said further, we have sent three Messengers back with the <i>Wagunhas</i>,
in order to confirm this Peace with their Nation.</p>

<p>After the <i>Seneka</i> Speaker had done, the <i>Wagunha</i> Presents were hung up
in the House, in the Sight of the whole Assembly, and afterwards
distributed among the several Nations, and their Acceptance was a
Ratification of the Treaty. A <b>large Belt was given</b> also to the <i>Albany</i>
Messengers as their Share.</p>

<p>The Belt of Wampum sent from <i>Albany</i> was in like Manner hanged up, and
afterwards divided.</p>

<p><i>New-England</i>, which the <i>Indians</i> call <i>Kinshon</i> (that is a Fish) sent
likewise the Model of a Fish, as a token of their adhering to the
general Covenant. This Fish was handed round among the <i>Sachems</i>, and
then laid aside to be put up.</p>

<p>After these Ceremonies were over, <i>Sadekanahtie</i>, an <i>Onondaga</i> Speaker,
stood up, and said, Brethren, we must stick to our Brother <i>Quider</i>, and
look on <i>Yonondio</i> as our Enemy, for he is a Cheat: By <i>Quider</i> they
meant <i>Peter Schyler</i> the Mayor of <i>Albany</i>, who had gained a
considerable Esteem among them; as they have no Labeals in their
Language, they pronounce <i>Peter</i> by the Sound <i>Quider</i>.</p>

<p>The Messenger from <i>Canada</i> had brought Letters, and some medicinal
Powder, for the Jesuit <i>Milet</i>, who resided at <i>Oneydo</i>. These Letters
and the Powder were delivered to the Interpreter from <i>Albany</i> to be
carried thither, that the Contents of them might be made known to the
<i>Sachems</i> of the several Nations. The Jesuit was present all this While
in their Council.</p>

<p>Then the Interpreter was desired to speak what he had to say from their
Brethren at <i>Albany</i>. He told them, that a new Governor was arrived, who
had brought a great many Soldiers from <i>England</i>. That the King of
<i>England</i> had declared War against <i>France</i>, and that the People of
<i>New-England</i> were fitting out Ships against <i>Canada</i>. He advised them,
that they should not hearken to the <i>French</i>, for when they talk of
Peace, said he, War is in their Heart, and desired them to enter into no
Treaty but at <i>Albany</i>, for the <i>French</i>, he said, would mind no
Agreement made any where else.</p>

<p>After this they had Consultations for some Time together, and then gave
the following Answer by their Speaker.</p>

<p>Brethren, our Fire burns at <i>Albany</i>. We will not send <i>Dekanasora</i> to
<i>Cadarackui</i>. We adhere to our old Chain with <i>Corlear</i>; we will
prosecute the War with <i>Yonondio</i>, and will follow your Advice in
drawing off our Men from <i>Cadarackui</i>. Brethren, we are glad to hear the
News you tell us, but tell us no Lies.</p>

<p>Brother <i>Kinshon</i>, we hear you design to send Soldiers to the eastward
against the <i>Indians</i> there; but we advise you, now so many are united
against the <i>French</i>, to fall immediately on them. Strike at the Root,
when the Trunk shall be cut down, the Branches fall of Course.</p>

<p><i>Corlear</i> and <i>Kinshon</i>, Courage! Courage! In the Spring to <i>Quebeck</i>,
take that Place, and you'll have your Feet on the Necks of the <i>French</i>,
and all their Friends in <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>After this they agreed to the following Answer to be sent to the
Governor of <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Yonondio</i>, you have notified your Return to us, and that you have
brought back 13 of our People that were carried to <i>France</i>, we are glad
of it. You desire us to meet you at <i>Cadarackui</i> next Spring, to treat
of the old Chain; but <i>Yonondio</i>, how can we trust you, after you have
acted deceitfully so often? Witness what was done at <i>Cadarackui</i>; the
Usage our Messengers met with at <i>Utawawa</i>, and what was done to the
<i>Senekas</i> at <i>Utawawa</i>. This was their Answer; however, they sent a Belt
with this, which always shews a Disposition to treat.</p>

<p>2. <i>Therhansera, Ohguesse</i> and <i>Ertel</i>, do you observe Friendship with
us, if you have not, how come you to advise us to renew Friendship with
<i>Yonondio</i>, they sent them likewise a Belt?</p>

<p>3. <i>Tawerahet</i>, the whole Council is glad to hear, that you are returned
with the other twelve. <i>Yonondio</i>, you must send home <i>Tawerahet</i> and
the others this very Winter, before Spring, and we will save all the
<i>French</i> that we have Prisoners till that Time.</p>

<p>4. <i>Yonondio</i>, you desire to speak with us at <i>Cadarackui</i>: Don't you
know that your Fire there is extinguished? It is extinguished with
Blood, you must send home the Prisoners in the first Place.</p>

<p>5. We let you know that we have made Peace with the <i>Wagunhas</i>.</p>

<p>6. You are not to think, that we have laid down the Axe, because we
return an Answer; we intend no such Thing: Our Fair-fighters shall
continue the War till our Countrymen return.</p>

<p>7. When our Brother <i>Tawerahet</i> is returned, then will we speak to you
of Peace.</p>

<p>As soon as the Council broke up, their Resolutions were made publick to
all their People, by the <i>Sachems</i> of their several Nations.</p>

<p>Two <i>Sachems</i> were sent to <i>Albany</i>, by their general Council, to inform
their Brethren there of their Resolutions, and to bring back the
Contents of the Letters sent from <i>Canada</i> to the Jesuit.</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived, one of the <i>Mohawks</i>, that had been sent from
<i>Albany</i> to the Council, delivered the <i>Wagunha</i> Belt, and repeated over
distinctly all the Articles agreed to with that Nation, and referred to
the <i>Onondaga Speaker</i>, being one of those sent by the Council of
<i>Albany</i>, to recite the Answer to the Governor of <i>Canada</i>. He rising
up, repeated over the whole as before set down, and added; The <i>French</i>
are full of Deceit; but I call God to witness, we have hitherto used no
Deceit with them, but how we shall act for the future, Time only can
discover. Then he assured the Brethren, that the <i>Five Nations</i> were
resolved to prosecute the War, in Token whereof he presented
<i>Quider</i><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> with a Belt, in which three Axes were represented. Perhaps
by this Representation only three Nations joined in sending it, the
<i>Cayugas</i> and <i>Oneydoes</i> being more under the Influence of the Jesuit
<i>Milet</i>, who lived among them intirely, according to their Manner of
Life, and was adopted by the <i>Oneydoes</i>, and made one of their
<i>Sachems</i>. The Letters from <i>Canada</i> to him were read, they contained
nothing but common News and Compliments.</p>

<p>The <i>Mohawk</i> Messengers, that had been sent from <i>Albany</i>, had carried
with them Goods to sell at the general Council. This was taken Notice of
at the general Council, and gave the <i>Indians</i> a mean Opinion of the
People of <i>Albany</i>, and particularly of <i>Peter Schyler</i>; for it is
exceedingly scandalous among the <i>Indians</i>, to employ a Merchant in
publick Affairs; Merchants, (I mean the Traders with the <i>Indians</i>) are
looked upon by them as Liars, and People not to be trusted, and of no
Credit, who by their Thoughts being continually turned upon Profit and
Loss, consider every Thing with that private View. As this made a Noise
at <i>Albany</i>, by its giving the Jesuit an Opportunity of setting the
Messengers from <i>Albany</i> in an ill Light, <i>Peter Scheyler</i> cleared
himself by Oath, of his having any Interest directly or indirectly in
those Goods, and sent a Belt back with his publick Justification. The
<i>Mohawk</i> Messengers had refused to take the Goods, as being scandalous
to the Business they went on; but were persuaded, by being told that the
Goods belonged to <i>Quider</i>.</p>

<p>The Magistrates of <i>Albany</i> advised the <i>Sachems</i>, to send the Jesuit
Prisoner to <i>Albany</i>, where he might be kept securely, without having it
in his Power to do Mischief, but they could not prevail. The <i>Indians</i>
were resolved to keep all the Means of making Peace in their own Hands.</p>

<h4><i>The</i> French <i>surprise</i> Schenectady. <i>The</i> Mohawks <i>Speech of
Condoleance on that Occasion</i>.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he <i>Count De Frontenac</i> being desirous, as before observed, to raise
the drooping Spirits of the <i>French</i> in <i>Canada</i>, by keeping them in
Action, and engaging the most daring of them, in Enterprizes that might
give Courage to the rest, had sent out three Parties against the
<i>English</i> Colonies, in Hopes thereby to lessen the Confidence which the
<i>Five Nations</i> had in the <i>English</i> Assistance, now that <i>England</i> had
declared War against <i>France</i>. The Party sent against <i>New-York</i> was
commanded by <i>Monsr. De Herville</i>, and was ordered to attempt the
surprising of <i>Schenectady</i>, the nearest Village to the <i>Mohawks</i>; It
consisted of 150 <i>French Bush-lopers</i> or <i>Indian</i> Traders, and of as
many <i>Indians</i>, the most of them <i>French</i> Converts from the <i>Mohawks</i>,
commonly called the <i>Praying Indians</i>, settled at a Place near
<i>Montreal</i>, called <i>Cahnuaga</i>. They were well acquainted with all that
Part of the Country round <i>Schenectady</i>; and came in Sight of the Place
the 8th of <i>February</i> 1689-90.</p>

<p>The People of <i>Schenectady</i> were at that Time in the greatest Security,
notwithstanding that they had Information from the <i>Indians</i>, of a Party
of <i>French</i>, and <i>French Indians</i> being upon their March that Way. They
did not think it practicable, in that Season of the Year, while it was
extremely cold, and the whole Country covered with Snow. Indeed
<i>Europeans</i> will hardly think it possible, that Men could make such a
March through the Wilderness in the severest Frosts, without any
Covering from the Heavens, or any Provision, except what they carried on
their Backs.</p>

<p>Tho' the People of <i>Schenectady</i> were informed in the Evening before the
Place was surprised, that several sculking <i>Indians</i> were seen near the
Place, they concluded, that they could be only some of the neighbouring
<i>Indians</i>; and as they had no Officer of any Esteem among them, not a
single Man could be persuaded to watch in such severe Weather, tho', as
the <i>French</i> owned afterwards, if they had found the least Guard or
Watch, they would not have attempted the Place, but have surrendered
themselves Prisoners: They were so exceedingly distressed with the
Length of their March, and with Cold, and Hunger, but finding the Place
in fatal Security, they marched into the Heart of the Village, without
being discovered by any one Person; then they raised their War Shout,
entered the Houses, murdered every Person they met, Men, Women, and
Children, naked and in cold Blood; and at the same Time set Fire to the
Houses. A very few escaped, by running out naked into the Woods in this
terrible Weather: And several hid themselves, till the first Fury of the
Attack was over; but these were soon driven from their lurking Places by
the Fire, and were all made Prisoners.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Alexander Glen</i>, at this Time, lived at a Distance by himself,
on the other Side of the River, and was the most noted Man in the Place.
He had at several Times been kind to the <i>French</i>, who had been taken
Prisoners by the <i>Mohawks</i>, and had saved several of them from the Fire.
The <i>French</i> were sensible what Horror this cruel sacking of a
defenceless Place, and murdering People in cold Blood, must raise in
Mens Minds; and to lessen this, they resolved to shew their Gratitude to
Captain <i>Glen</i>. They had passed his House in the Night, and observing
that he stood on his Defence the next Morning, some of them went to the
River Side, and calling to him, assured him, that they designed him no
Injury. They persuaded him to come to the <i>French</i> Officer, who restored
to him all his Relations that were Prisoners.</p>

<p>Some <i>Mohawks</i> being also found in the Village, the <i>French</i> dismissed
them, with Assurance, that they designed them no Hurt.</p>

<p>This Conduct was not only necessary to promote the Peace which the
<i>Count De Frontenac</i> with so much Earnestness desired, but likewise to
secure their Retreat, by making the <i>Mohawks</i> less eager to pursue them.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> marched back, without reaping any visible Advantage from
this barbarous Enterprize, besides the murdering sixty-three innocent
Persons in cold Blood, and carrying twenty-seven of them away Prisoners.</p>

<p>The Care the <i>French</i> took to sooth the <i>Mohawks</i> had not intirely it's
Effect, for as soon as they heard of this Action, a hundred of their
readiest young Men pursued the <i>French</i>, fell upon their Rear, and
killed and took twenty-five of them.</p>

<p>This Action frightened the Inhabitants in and about <i>Albany</i> so much,
that many resolved to desert the Place, and retire to <i>New-York</i>. They
were packing up and preparing for this Purpose, when the <i>Mohawk
Sachems</i> came to <i>Albany</i> to condole, according to their Custom, with
their Friends, when any Misfortune befals them. I shall give their
Speech on this Occasion, as it will be of Use to the Reader, in order to
his forming a true Notion of the <i>Indian Genius</i>. They spoke the
twenty-fifth of <i>March</i> as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Brethren, the Murder of our Brethren at <i>Schenectady</i> by the
<i>French</i> grieves us as much, as if it had been done to our
selves, for we are in the same Chain; and no Doubt our Brethren
of <i>New-England</i> will be likewise sadly affected with this cruel
Action of the <i>French</i>. The <i>French</i> on this Occasion have not
acted like brave Men, but like Thieves and Robbers. Be not
therefore discouraged. We <b>give this Belt</b> <i>to wipe away your
Tears</i>.</p>

<p>"Brethren, we lament the Death of so many of our Brethren, whose
Blood has been shed at <i>Schenectady</i>. We don't think that what
the <i>French</i> have done can be called a Victory, it is only a
farther Proof of their cruel Deceit. The Governor of <i>Canada</i>
sends to <i>Onondaga</i>, and talks to us of Peace with our whole
House, but War was in his Heart, as you now see by woful
Experience. He did the same formerly at <i>Cadarackui</i>, and in the
<i>Senekas</i> Country. This is the third Time he has acted so
deceitfully. He has broken open our House at both Ends, formerly
in the <i>Senekas</i> Country, and now here. We hope however to be
revenged of them. One Hundred of our bravest young Men are in
Pursuit of them, they are brisk Fellows, and they will follow
the <i>French</i> to their Doors. We will beset them so closely,
that not a Man in <i>Canada</i> shall dare to step out of Doors to
cut a Stick of Wood; But now <i>we gather up our Dead, to bury
them</i>, by <b>this second Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"Brethren, we came from our Castles with Tears in our Eyes, to
bemoan the Bloodshed at <i>Schenectady</i> by the Perfidious
<i>French</i>. While we bury our Dead murdered at <i>Schenectady</i>, we
know not what may have befallen our own People, that are in
Pursuit of the Enemy, they may be dead; what has befallen you
may happen to us; and therefore <i>we come to bury our Brethren
at</i> Schenectady with <b>this third Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"Great and sudden is the Mischief, as if it had fallen from
Heaven upon us. Our Forefathers taught us to go with all Speed
to bemoan and lament with our Brethren, when any Disaster or
Misfortune happens to any in our Chain. Take this Bill of
Vigilance, that you may be more watchful for the future. <i>We
give our Brethren Eye-Water</i> to make them sharp sighted, <b>giving
a fourth Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"We are now come to the House where we usually renew the Chain;
but alas! we find the House polluted, polluted with Blood. All
the <i>Five Nations</i> have heard of this, and we are come to wipe
away the Blood, and clean the House. We come to invite
<i>Corlear</i>, and every one of you, and <i>Quider</i> (calling to every
one of the principal Men present by their Names) <i>to be revenged
of the Enemy</i>, by <b>this fifth Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"Brethren, be not discouraged, we are strong enough. This is the
Beginning of your War, and the whole House have their Eyes fixed
upon you at this Time, to observe your Behaviour. They wait your
Motion, and are ready to join in any resolute Measures.</p>

<p>"Our Chain is a strong Chain, it is a Silver Chain, it can
neither rust nor be broken. We, as to our Parts, are resolute to
continue the War.</p>

<p>"We will never desist, so long as a Man of us remains. Take
Heart, do not pack up and go away, <a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> this will give Heart to
a dastardly Enemy. We are of the Race of the Bear, and a Bear
you know never yields, while one Drop of Blood is left. <i>We must
all be Bears</i>; <b>giving a sixth Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"Brethren be patient, this Disaster is an Affliction which has
fallen from Heaven upon us. The Sun, which hath been cloudy, and
sent this Disaster, will shine again with its pleasant Beams.
Take Courage, said he, Courage, repeating the Word several Times
as they <b>gave a seventh Belt</b>.</p></div>

<p>
(<i>To the</i> English.)<br />
</p>

<p>Brethren, three Years ago we were engaged in a bloody War with the
<i>French</i>, and you encouraged us to proceed in it. Our Success answered
our Expectation; but we were not well begun, when <i>Corlear</i> stopt us
from going on. Had you permitted us to go on, the <i>French</i> would not now
have been able to do the Mischief, they have done, we would have
prevented their sowing, planting or reaping.</p>

<p>We would have humbled them effectually, but now we dye. The Obstructions
you then made now ruin us. Let us after this be steady, and take no such
false Measures for the future, but <i>prosecute the War vigorously</i>.
<b>Giving a Bever Skin.</b></p>

<p>The Brethren must keep good Watch, and if the Enemy come again, send
more speedily to us. Don't desert <i>Schenectady</i>. The Enemy will glory in
seeing it desolate. It will give them Courage that had none before,
<i>fortify the Place</i>, it is not well fortified now: The <i>Stockadoes</i> are
too short, the <i>Indians</i> can jump over them. <b>Gave a Bever Skin.</b></p>

<p>Brethren, The Mischief done at <i>Schenectady</i> cannot be helped now; but
for the future, when the Enemy appears any where, let nothing hinder
your sending to us by Expresses, and fire great Guns, that all may be
alarmed. We advise you to bring all the <i>River Indians</i> under your
Subjection to live near <i>Albany</i>, to be ready on all Occasions.</p>

<p>Send to <i>New-England</i>, tell them what has happened to you. They will
undoubtedly awake and lend us their helping Hand. It is their Interest,
as much as ours, to push the War to a speedy Conclusion. Be not
discouraged, the <i>French</i> are not so numerous as some People talk. If we
but heartily unite to push on the War, and mind <i>our Business, the</i>
French <i>will soon be subdued</i>.</p>

<p>The Magistrates having returned an Answer on the twenty seventh, to the
Satisfaction of the <i>Indians</i>, they repeated it all over, Word by Word,
to let the Magistrates see how carefully they minded it, and then added,</p>

<p>Brethren, we are glad to find you are not discouraged. The best and
wisest Men sometimes make Mistakes. Let us now pursue the War
vigorously. We have a hundred Men out, they are good Scouts. We expect
to meet all the <i>Sachems</i> of the other Nations, as they come to condole
with you. You need not fear our being ready, at the first Notice. Our Ax
is always in our Hands, but take Care that you be timely ready. Your
Ships, that must do the principal Work, are long a fitting out. We do
not design to go out with a small Company, or in sculking Parties; but
as soon as the Nations can meet, we shall be ready with our whole Force.
If you would bring this War to a happy Issue, you must begin soon,
before the <i>French</i> can recover the Losses they have received from us,
and get new Vigour and Life, therefore send in all Haste to
<i>New-England</i>. Neither you nor we can continue long in the Condition we
are now in, we must order Matters so, that the <i>French</i> be kept in
continual Fear and Alarm at home; for this is the only Way to be secure,
and in Peace here.</p>

<p>The <i>Scahkok Indians</i>, in our Opinion, are well placed where they are
(to the Northward of <i>Albany</i>); they are a good Out-guard; they are our
Children, and we shall take Care that they do their Duty: But you must
take Care of the <i>Indians</i> below the Town, place them nearer the Town,
so as they may <i>be of most Service to you</i>.</p>

<p>Here we see the <i>Mohawks</i> acting like hearty Friends, and if the Value
of the Belts given at that Time be considered, together with what they
said on that Occasion, they gave the strongest Proofs of their
Sincerity. Each of these Belts amount to a large Sum in the <i>Indian</i>
Account.</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> of <i>New-York</i> and the <i>French</i> of <i>Canada</i> were now
entering into a War, in which the Part the <i>Five Nations</i> are to take is
of the greatest Consequence to both; the very Being of the <i>French</i>
Colony depended on it, as well as the Safety of the <i>English</i>. The
<i>Indians</i> at this Time had the greatest Aversion to the <i>French</i>, and
they desired nothing so much, as that the <i>English</i> might join heartily
in this War. We shall see by the Sequel how a publick Spirit, directed
by wise Counsels, can overcome all Difficulties, while a selfish Spirit
loses all, even natural Advantages. In the present Case, the Turn Things
took seems to have been entirely owing to one Thing. The French in
making the Count <i>de Frontenac</i> Governor of <i>Canada</i>, chose the Man
every Way the best qualified for this Service: The <i>English</i> seemed to
have little Regard to the Qualification of the Person they sent, but to
gratify a Relation or a Friend, by giving him an Opportunity to make a
Fortune; and as he knew that he was recommended with this View, his
Counsels were chiefly employed for this Purpose.</p>

<p>By this Means an <i>English Governor</i> generally wants the Esteem of the
People; while they think that a Governor has not the Good of the People
in View, but his own, they on all Occasions are jealous of him; so that
even a good Governor, with more Difficulty, pursues generous Purposes
and publick Benefits, because the People suspect them to be mere
Pretences to cover a private Design. It is for this Reason, that any
Man, opposing a Governor, is sure to meet with the Favour of the People,
almost in every Case. On the other Hand, the Opinion the <i>French</i> had of
the Count <i>de Frontenac</i>'s publick Spirit, and of his Wisdom and
Diligence, made them enter into all his Measures without hesitating, and
chearfully obey all his Commands.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_2_V" id="CHAP_2_V"></a>CHAP. V.</h2>

<h4><i>The</i> Five Nations <i>continue the War with the</i> French; <i>the</i> Mohawks
<i>incline to Peace</i>; <i>their Conferences with the</i> Governor <i>of</i> New-York.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he <i>Governor</i> of <i>Canada</i> received Hopes that the <i>Five Nations</i>
inclined to Peace, by their returning an Answer to <i>Therawaet</i>'s
Message, and thought he might now venture to send some <i>French</i> to them
with further Proposals. The Chevalier <i>D'O</i>, with an Interpreter called
<i>Collin</i>, and some others, went; but they had a much warmer Reception
than they expected, being forced to run the Gauntlet through a long Lane
of <i>Indians</i>, as they entered their Castle, and were afterwards
delivered up Prisoners to the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> kept out at this Time small Parties, that continually
harassed the <i>French</i>. The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> sent Captain <i>Louvigni</i>
to <i>Missilimakinak</i>, to relieve the Garison, and he had Orders, by all
Means, to prevent the Peace which the <i>Utawawas</i> and <i>Quatoghies</i> were
upon the Point of concluding with the <i>Five Nations</i>. He carried with
him one hundred forty three <i>French</i>, and six <i>Indians</i>, and was
likewise accompanied with a Lieutenant and thirty Men, till he got one
hundred twenty Miles from <i>Montreal</i>. They were met in <i>Cadarackui
River</i>, at a Place called the <i>Cats</i>, by a Party of the <i>Five Nations</i>,
who fell vigorously on their Canoes, killed several of the <i>French</i>, and
made them give Way; but <i>Louvigni</i>, by putting his Men ashore, at last
got the better, after a smart Engagement, in which the <i>Indians</i> had
several Men killed, and two Men, and as many Women, taken Prisoners. I
am obliged to rely on the <i>French</i> Account of these Skirmishes; they do
not mention the Number of the <i>Indians</i> in this Rencounter, but I
suspect them to have been much fewer than the <i>French</i>; for when the
Enemy are equal in Number, or greater, they seldom forget to tell it.
One of the <i>Indian</i> Prisoners was carried by them to <i>Missilimackinak</i>,
to confirm this Victory, and was delivered to the <i>Utawawas</i>, who eat
him. The Lieutenant carried the other back with him. He was given to
<i>Therawaet</i>.</p>

<p>To revenge this Loss, the <i>Five Nations</i> sent a Party against the
<i>Island of Montreal</i>, who fell on that Part called the <i>Trembling
Point</i>; and though they were discovered before they gave their Blow,
they attacked a Party of regular Troops, and killed the commanding
Officer, and twelve of his Men: Another Party carried off fifteen or
sixteen Prisoners from <i>Riviere Puante</i>, over against <i>Trois Rivieres</i>.
This Party was pursued, and finding that they were like to be
overpowered, murdered their Prisoners and made their Escape. These
Incursions kept all the River, from <i>Montreal</i> to <i>Quebeck</i>, in
continual Alarm, and obliged the Governor to send all the Soldiers to
guard the south Side of the River. Notwithstanding this, five Persons
were carried away in Sight of <i>Sorel Fort</i>, by a small skulking Party,
but they were soon afterwards recovered by the Soldiers. About the same
Time another Party burnt the Plantations at <i>St. Ours</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> had conceived great Hopes from the Assistance of the
<i>English</i>, as the Magistrates of <i>Albany</i> had promised the <i>Mohawks</i>,
when they came to condole, after the surprising of <i>Schenectady</i>; but
the <i>English</i> were so far from performing these Promises, that many of
the Inhabitants retired from <i>Albany</i> to <i>New-York</i>; and they who had
the Administration of Affairs, were so intent on their party Quarrels,
that they intirely neglected the <i>Indian</i> Affairs. Indeed the People of
<i>New-York</i> have too often made large Promises, and have thereby put the
<i>Indians</i> upon bold Enterprizes, when no Measures were concerted for
supporting them. This made the <i>Indians</i> think, that the <i>English</i> were
lavish of <i>Indian</i> Lives and too careful of their own. The <i>Mohawks</i>,
who lived nearest the <i>English</i>, were most sensible of these Things, and
soon entertained Notions prejudicial to the Opinion they ought to have
had of the <i>English</i> Prudence and Conduct; it is even probable, these
<i>Indians</i> began to entertain a mean Opinion of both the <i>English</i>
Courage and Integrity. It is not strange then, that the <i>Mohawks</i> at
last gave Ear to the assiduous Application of their Countrymen, the
<i>praying Indians</i>, who, with <i>French</i> Arguments, persuaded them to make
Peace as soon as possible, without trusting longer to the <i>English</i>, who
had so often disappointed or deceived them.</p>

<p>The <i>Mohawks</i> sent one of their <i>Sachems</i>, <i>Odigacege</i>, to the <i>praying
Indians</i>, who introduced him to the Count <i>de Frontenac</i>. The Count made
him welcome, and told him, that he was sorry for the Injuries his
Predecessors had done them; but that he would treat them like Friends,
if their future Conduct did not prevent him, and <b>gave him a Belt</b>, with
Proposals of Peace to his Nation.</p>

<p>Colonel <i>Slaughter</i>, who was then Governor of <i>New-York</i>, being
informed that the <i>Five Nations</i> were like to make Peace with the
<i>French</i>, by their having lost much of their Confidence in the <i>English</i>
Assistance, found it necessary to meet them, which he did in the End of
<i>May</i> 1691. There were present at that Time six <i>Oneydo</i>, eleven
<i>Onondaga</i>, four <i>Cayuga</i>, and ten <i>Seneka Sachems</i>. He renewed the
Covenant with them, and gave them Presents. The <i>Mohawks</i> having entered
into a Treaty with the <i>French</i>, did not join with the other four
Nations in their Answer.</p>

<p>On the second of <i>June</i> the Speaker, in Name of the other four Nations,
told him, they were glad to see a Governor again in this Place; that
they had learned from their Ancestors, that the first Ship which arrived
in this Country surprized them exceedingly; that they were curious to
know what was in its huge Belly. They found Christians in it, and among
them one <i>Jacques</i>, with whom they made a Chain of Friendship, which has
been preserved to this Day. By that Chain it was agreed, that whatever
Injury was done to the one, should be deemed, by both Sides, as likewise
done to the other. Then they mentioned the Confusion that had lately
been in the Government of <i>New-York</i>, which had like to have confounded
all their Affairs, but hoped all would be reduced to their wonted Order
and Quiet. They complained of several of the Brethren leaving <i>Albany</i>
in Time of Danger, and praised those by Name who staid, and then said:
Our Tree of Peace, which grows in this Place, has of late been much
shaken, we must now secure and fasten its Roots; we must frequently
manure and dress it, that its Roots may spread far.</p>

<p>They assured the Governor, that they were resolved to prosecute the War
against the <i>French</i> as long as they lived, and that they would never
speak of Peace, but with the common Consent. They abhor those that do
otherwise, and desired that the Brethren might not keep a
Correspondence with <i>Canada</i> by Letters. You need not (said they) press
us to mind the War, we mind it above all Things; do you but your Parts,
lay aside all other Thoughts but that of the War, for it is the only
Thing we have at Heart. They <b>gave Bevers</b> at the End of every distinct
Part of their Answer.</p>

<p>On the fourth the <i>Mohawks</i> spoke to the Governor, in Presence of the
other four Nations: They confessed the Negotiations they had with the
<i>Praying Indians</i>, and with the Governor of <i>Canada</i>, and that they had
received a Belt from him. Then they restored one of the Prisoners taken
at <i>Schenectady</i>, as the Fruit of that Negotiation. They desired the
Governor's Advice, and the Advice of the whole House, what Answer to
return to the Governor of <i>Canada</i>; and lastly, desired the <i>Senekas</i> to
release the Prisoners they had taken from the <i>Praying Indians</i>.</p>

<p>Colonel <i>Slaughter</i> check'd the <i>Mohawks</i> for entering into a separate
Treaty with the Enemy, and said he could admit of no Proposals of Peace.
He told them, that the Prisoners taken from the <i>Praying Indians</i> must
not be restored; putting them in mind, that some of them having been
formerly released, soon after returned and murdered several People, and
burnt several Houses.</p>

<p>He assured them of his Assistance, and then added, You must keep the
Enemy in perpetual Alarm. The <i>Mohawks</i> thanked him for his Assurance of
Assistance; but took Notice of his saying, <i>You</i> must keep the Enemy in
perpetual Alarm. Why don't you say, they replied, We will keep the Enemy
in perpetual Alarm. In the last Place, the <i>Mohawks</i> renewed their
League with all the <i>English</i> Colonies; adding, Though an angry Dog has
endeavoured to bite the Chain in Pieces, we are resolved to keep it
firm, both in Peace and in War: We now renew the old Chain, that so the
Tree of Peace and Prosperity may flourish, and spread its Roots through
all the Country.</p>

<p>In the last Place, the four Nations answered the <i>Mohawks</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Mohawks</i>, our Brethren, in answer to your Proposals from the
Governor of <i>Canada</i>, we must put you in Mind of his Deceit and
Treachery; we need only give one recent Instance, how he lately
sent to the <i>Senekas</i> to treat of Peace, and at the same Time
fell upon <i>Schenectady</i>, and cut that Place off. We tell you,
that the Belt sent by the <i>French</i> Governor is Poison; we spew
it out of our Mouths, we absolutely reject it, and are resolved
to prosecute the War as long as we live."</p></div>
<p>Then they left the Belt lying on the Ground.</p>

<h4><i>The</i> English <i>attack</i> Montreal <i>by Land</i>, <i>in Conjunction with the</i>
Indians, <i>and</i> Quebeck <i>by Sea</i>.</h4>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was now evident that the <i>Indians</i> could no longer be amused with
Words, and that, unless the <i>English</i> entered soon upon Action, the
<i>French</i> would carry their Design of making Peace with the <i>Five
Nations</i>, and the <i>English</i> be left to carry on the War in <i>America</i> by
themselves. Certainly a more proper Opportunity of doing it with Success
could not be expected, than at present, while the <i>French</i> in <i>Canada</i>
had neither recovered their Spirits, nor the Strength they had lost, by
the terrible Incursions of the <i>Five Nations</i>. A joint Invasion on
<i>Canada</i> was concerted with <i>New-England</i>, they were to attack
<i>Quebeck</i> by Sea, while <i>New-York</i> attacked <i>Montreal</i> by Land. The
Governor therefore proposed to the <i>Indians</i> to join with him in
attacking <i>Canada</i>, for which Purpose he told them, that he designed to
send a considerable Force this Summer. They desired Time to consult on
it at their general Meeting, which was soon to be held at <i>Onondaga</i>,
and to know what Number of Christians he designed to send, that they
might join a suitable Number of their Men. To this the Governor
answered, that he must not communicate the Particulars of his Design to
so many, because they could not then be kept secret from the Enemy; as
he found by the Discoveries that were last Year made to the <i>French</i> by
that Means.</p>

<p>It was at last agreed, that the <i>Mohawks</i> should join with the
Christians that were to march from <i>New-York</i> directly against
<i>Montreal</i>, and that the other four Nations should send a considerable
Party down <i>Cadarackui Lake</i>, and join them before <i>Montreal</i>.</p>

<p>Major <i>Peter Schuyler</i>, the same whom the <i>Indians</i> call <i>Quider</i>,
commanded the Party sent from <i>New-York</i>, which consisted of three
hundred Men, one half Christians, the other <i>Mohawks</i> and <i>Scahkook
Indians</i>. He set out from <i>Albany</i> about Midsummer. As he was preparing
his Canoes to pass <i>Corlear</i>'s Lake, he was discovered by the <i>French
Indians</i>, who immediately returned to <i>Montreal</i>, to give Information of
what they had seen. The Chevalier <i>Clermont</i> was sent out to make
further Discoveries: He found the <i>English</i> above <i>Chamblie</i>, and went
immediately back with the Intelligence he there gained. In the mean
while Mr. <i>de Callieres</i>, Governor of <i>Montreal</i>, did all in his Power
to give Major <i>Schuyler</i> a proper Reception, by drawing the Militia and
regular Troops together for the Defence of the Place. There happened to
be a very considerable Number of <i>Utawawas</i> trading at that Time at
<i>Montreal</i>, Mr. <i>de Colliere</i>, in Order to engage them to join him, made
a great Feast for them, went among them, and, after the <i>Indian</i> Manner,
began the war Song, leading up the Dance with his Axe in his Hand, and
shouting and hollowing in the same wild Manner the <i>Indians</i> do. This
done, he carried his whole Force, which consisted of twelve hundred Men,
cross the River, and encamped on the south Side, at <i>la Prairie de la
Magdeleine</i>, together with a great Number of <i>Utawawas</i>, the <i>Praying
Indians</i>, and other <i>French Indians</i>. The famous <i>Therawaet</i> being now
entirely gained by the Caresses of the Count <i>de Frontenac</i>, made one of
the Number. They encamped round the Fort, which stood on a steep rising
Ground between two Meadows.</p>

<p>Major <i>Schuyler</i> having left forty of his Men to guard his Canoes, which
had carried him cross the Lake, marched on without stopping. He got into
a Hollow, which led into the Meadow, without being discovered; and
marching under that Cover, he fell suddenly upon the Militia, who were
soon put into Confusion, and many of them, and of the <i>Utawawas</i>, who
were posted with them, were killed. He pursued them as they fled to the
Fort, which he attacked briskly, but was obliged to leave it, by the
Approach of the regular Troops who came to relieve it. He received them
however bravely, and, after they had lost several Officers and many Men,
they retired. Major <i>Schuyler</i> finding the Number of the Enemy much
greater than was expected, and being informed that a considerable Party
of the Enemy had marched Southward, he began to apprehend, that this
Party was sent to cut off his Retreat, by destroying his Canoes. It was
resolved therefore immediately to follow this Party; he overtook them,
and they covering themselves behind some large fallen Trees, he attacked
them, and made his Way through them, but with considerable Loss.</p>

<p>In this Attack the <i>Mohawks</i> signalized themselves, but the <i>Scahkook
Indians</i> did not behave themselves well. The <i>Mohawks</i>, upon no
Occasion, yielded an Inch of Ground, till the <i>English</i> first gave Way.
The <i>French</i>, by their own Accounts, lost, in the several Attacks made
by <i>Schuyler</i>, two Captains, six Lieutenants, and five Ensigns, and, in
all, three hundred Men, so that their Slain were in Number more than
Major <i>Schuyler</i> had with him. The <i>Mohawks</i> suffered much, having
seventeen Men killed, and eleven wounded. They returned to <i>Albany</i> the
eleventh of <i>August</i>.</p>

<p>After the <i>English</i> under Major <i>Schuyler</i> had retired, an <i>Owenagunga
Indian</i> came from <i>New-England</i>, with an Account of the Preparations
made there against <i>Canada</i>, and that they had actually sailed.</p>

<p>This Fleet, which was commanded by <i>Sir William Phips</i>, was discovered
in <i>St. Laurence Bay</i>, while the Count <i>de Frontenac</i> remained at
<i>Montreal</i>; and thereupon he made all possible Haste to <i>Quebeck</i>, and
carried three hundred Men with him.</p>

<p>The Fleet, which consisted of thirty Sail, did not reach <i>Quebeck</i> till
the seventh of <i>October</i>. Sir <i>William</i> spent three Days in nothing but
Consultation, while the <i>French</i> made all possible Preparation for a
Defence, and, by this Means, suffered them to get over the Fright and
Consternation, into which the first Appearance of the Fleet had thrown
them; for the Place was not in any Posture of Defence. It gave them Time
likewise to draw all the Country round them into the Town. And on the
fourth Day Sir <i>William</i> summoned the <i>Count</i> to surrender, who returned
him such an Answer as his Conduct deserved.</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> landed four Miles below the Town, and had thick Woods to
march through, before they could come at it, in which Ambuscades of
<i>French</i> and <i>Indians</i> were made at proper Distances, by whom the
<i>English</i> were repulsed with considerable Loss. They attempted the Wood
again the next Day with no better Success.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i>, in their Account of this Action, say, that the Men, though
they appeared to be as little disciplined as Men could be, behaved with
great Bravery, but that Sir <i>William</i>'s Conduct was such, that, if he
had been in Concert with them, he could not have done more to ruin the
Enterprize; yet his Fidelity was never suspected. In short, this Descent
was so ill managed, that the <i>English</i> got on Board again in the Night,
with the Loss of all the Cannon and Baggage which they had landed.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> thought themselves in such great Danger at that Time, that
they attributed their Deliverance to the most immediate Protection of
Heaven, in confounding the Devices of their Enemy, and by depriving them
of common Sense; and for this Reason the People of <i>Quebeck</i> make an
annual Procession, in Commemoration of this Deliverance.</p>

<p>Sir <i>William</i> cannonaded the Town for some Time with little Execution,
and then returned in Hast, Winter approaching; indeed that Season was
already so far advanced, that he lost eight Vessels in his Return.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> continued their Incursions all along <i>St. Laurence
River</i>, from <i>Montreal</i> to <i>Quebeck</i>, and carried away many Scalps. At
one Time a <i>French</i> Officer, with thirty eight Men, surprised some of
the <i>Five Nations</i> in a Cabin, which they had built near <i>Lake St.
Piere</i>. Some of them escaped and informed two other Cabins, which the
<i>French</i> had not discovered, and they returned with their Companions,
and killed the Captain and Lieutenant, and one half of the Men.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the <i>French</i> preserved their Country, these
warlike Expeditions, and the Necessity they were under of being on their
Guard, prevented their cultivating the Ground, or of reaping the Fruit
of what they had sowed or planted. This occasioned a Famine in <i>Canada</i>,
and, to increase the Misery of the poor Inhabitants, they were forced to
feed the Soldiers gratis, while their own Children wanted Bread.</p>

<p>In <i>October</i> the <i>Onondagas</i>, <i>Cayugas</i>, and <i>Oneydoes</i> came to
<i>Albany</i>, to condole with the <i>English</i>, for the Men lost in the
Expedition against <i>Montreal</i>, as they had already done with the
<i>Mohawks</i>. They said it was ever their Custom to condole with their
Friends when they lost any Number of Men in Battle, though they had the
Victory. They at the same Time, as they had often done before,
complained of the Dearness of Powder: Why, say they, do you call us your
King's Soldiers, when you will not sell us Powder at the usual and
reasonable Rates?</p>

<p>And in answer to a Complaint, of there not being a sufficient Number of
<i>English</i> sent against <i>Montreal</i>, the People of <i>Albany</i> upbraided them
with a Breach of Promise, in not sending that Party down <i>Cadarackui
River</i> which they promised, which they said was the chief Reason of the
want of Success in that Expedition.</p>

<h4><i>The</i> French <i>and the</i> Five Nations <i>continue the War all Winter with
various Success</i>. <i>The</i> French <i>burn a</i> Captain <i>of the</i> Five Nations
<i>alive</i>.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he old <i>French</i> Governor kept up his Vigour and Spirits wonderfully, no
Fatigue made him ever think of Rest. He knew of what Use it would be to
convince the <i>Five Nations</i>, that the joint Attack of the <i>English</i> and
<i>Indians</i> had neither weakened him, nor frightened him from carrying on
the War with as much Vigour as before.</p>

<p>It was absolutely necessary that the <i>Utawawas</i> and other <i>Western
Indians</i>, who came to <i>Montreal</i> to trade, should return safe to their
own Country, otherwise there would be an End to the <i>French</i> Trade with
those Nations, upon which the Being of <i>Canada</i> depends; for it is only
by the <i>Fur-trade</i> with these Nations that they make Returns to
<i>Europe</i>; and if these Nations did not return in Time, all the <i>Western
Indians</i> would look on the <i>French</i> as lost, and consequently would make
Peace with the <i>Five Nations</i>, and perhaps join in the Destruction of
<i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>Captain <i>la Forest</i>, with one hundred and ten Men, was sent to conduct
the <i>Utawawas</i> Home; he carried with him considerable Presents sent by
the King of <i>France</i>, to confirm these Nations in the <i>French</i> Interest.</p>

<p>Two <i>Indian</i> Prisoners, taken at <i>la Prairie</i>, were given to the
<i>Utawawas</i>, and carried with them, to confirm the Stories they were to
tell of their Successes against the <i>English</i> and <i>Five Nations</i>. These
poor Men were there burnt alive; and if I should add, that it was done
by <i>French</i> Instigation, what I shall relate by and by will clear me of
the want of Charity. I believe it was so, in Order to rivet the Hatred
between these People and the <i>Five Nations</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> continued their Incursions all Winter on <i>Canada</i>.
Forty of the <i>Mohawks</i> fell upon <i>Fort Vercheres</i>, and carried off
twenty of the Inhabitants; but the Alarm reaching <i>Montreal</i>, Mr. <i>de
Crizaei</i>, with one hundred Men of the regular Troops, was sent in
pursuit of them, who recovered most of the Prisoners.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> being informed, that a considerable Party of
the <i>Five Nations</i> hunted Bever on the Neck of Land between <i>Cadarackui
Lake</i> and <i>Lake Erie</i>, with great Security, resolved to give them a
better Opinion of the Strength and Courage of the <i>French</i>. For this
Purpose he sent three hundred and twelve Men to surprise them, under the
Command of Mr. <i>Beaucour</i>, a young Gentleman. The <i>Praying Indians</i> of
<i>Montreal</i> were of the Party. This Expedition being in the Winter, they
were obliged to undergo cruel Fatigues, while they marched on the Snow
with snow Shoes, and carried all their Provision on their Backs. Several
of the <i>French</i> had their Feet frozen, which obliged fifteen to return,
with some old <i>Indians</i>, that could not bear the Fatigue; and it was
with much Difficulty that <i>Beaucour</i> could persuade the rest to continue
their March. After a March to a surprizing Distance, at that Season of
the Year, they surprised eighty of the <i>Five Nations</i>, who
notwithstanding made a brave Defence, and did not run before they left
most of their Men dead on the Spot. Three Women were made Prisoners,
with whom the <i>French</i> immediately turned back to <i>Montreal</i>. Some
stragling Parties went towards <i>Albany</i>, but did no more Mischief than
killing two or three stragling Persons, and alarming the Country.</p>

<p>The Trade to <i>Missilimakinak</i> being still intirely stopt, by the Parties
of the <i>Five Nations</i> investing <i>Cadarackui River</i>, by which, and
<i>Cadarackui Lake</i>, the Passage in Canoes is made to the <i>Western
Indians</i>, Captain <i>la Noue</i>, with a Command of the regular Troops, was
ordered early in the Spring to guard the Traders through that Passage;
but when he reached the <i>Falls de Calumette</i>, he discovered the Enemy,
and returned faster than he went.</p>

<p><i>La Noue</i> had Orders a second Time to attempt this Passage, and went as
far as the River <i>du Lievre</i> (thirty Leagues from <i>Montreal</i>) without
any Obstruction; but there discovering several Canoes of the <i>Five
Nations</i>, he went back as fast as before.</p>

<p>The <i>Quatoghies</i> and the <i>Bullheads</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> having informed the <i>French</i> of
another smaller River, which falls into <i>Cadarackui River</i>, and runs to
the Northward of it, by which a Passage might be made to the Lakes, it
was resolved to attempt this Passage, though it were much farther round,
and more dangerous, there being many more rapid Falls in that River.
Three Officers, with thirty Soldiers, were sent with the Traders for
this Purpose, but a Party of the <i>Five Nations</i> meeting with them in the
long Fall, before they reached this River, they were all killed or
taken, except four that escaped back to <i>Montreal</i>.</p>

<p>A considerable Party of the <i>Five Nations</i>, under the Command of
<i>Blackkettle</i>, a famous Hero, continued a long Time on <i>Cadarackui
River</i>, in hopes of meeting with other <i>French</i> Parties, in their
Passage towards <i>Missilimakinak</i>; but finding that no Attempts were made
that Way, he resolved to make an Irruption into the Country round
<i>Montreal</i>. The <i>French</i> say he had six hundred Men with him; but they
usually increase the Number of their Enemies, in the Relation they give
of these Transactions, either to excuse their Fears, or to increase
their Glory.</p>

<p><i>Blackkettle</i> overrun the Country (to use the <i>French</i> Expression) as a
Torrent does the Low-lands, when it overflows its Banks, and there is no
withstanding it. The Soldiers had Orders to stand upon the defensive
within their Forts. Mr. <i>de Vaudreuil</i> pursued this Party (after they
had burnt and ravaged the whole Country) at the Head of four hundred
Men; he overtook them and surprised them. The <i>Five Nations</i> fought
desperately, though the same Author, at this Place, makes them no more
than two hundred Men. After they had lost twenty Men on the Spot, they
broke through the <i>French</i>, and marched off. The <i>French</i> lost four
Officers and many common Soldiers, and they took five Men, nine Women,
and five Children Prisoners.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> in a few Days had however some Revenge; a Captain
having had Orders to guard the Vessels from <i>Montreal</i> to <i>Quebeck</i>, a
Party of the <i>Five Nations</i> attacked him in his Return, as he passed
through the Islands in <i>Lake St. Pierre</i>. He himself was killed, and the
whole Party intirely routed.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> all this Summer were obliged to keep upon the defensive
within their Forts, while the <i>Five Nations</i>, in small Parties, ravaged
the whole Country, so that no Man stirred the least Distance from a
Fort, but he was in danger of losing his Scalp.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> was pierced to the Heart, when he found that he
could not revenge these terrible Incursions of the <i>Five Nations</i>; and
his Anguish made him guilty of such a Piece of monstrous Cruelty, in
burning a Prisoner alive after the <i>Indian</i> Manner, as though I have
frequently mentioned to have been done by the <i>Indians</i>, yet I forbore
giving the Particulars of such barbarous Acts, suspecting it might be
too offensive to Christian Ears, even in the History of Savages. Here
however I think it useful to give a circumstantial Account of this
horrid Act, to shew on one Hand, what Courage and Resolution, Virtue,
the Love of Glory, and the Love of one's Country can instill into Mens
Minds, even where the Knowledge of true Religion is wanting; and on the
other Hand, how far a false Policy, under a corrupt Religion, can debase
even great Minds.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Frontenac</i>, I say, condemned two Prisoners of the <i>Five
Nations</i> to be burnt publickly alive. The Intendant's Lady intreated
him to moderate the Sentence, and the Jesuits, it is said, used their
Endeavours for the same Purpose. But the Count <i>de Frontenac</i> said,
there is a Necessity of making such an Example, to frighten the <i>Five
Nations</i> from approaching the Plantations, since the Indulgence, that
had hitherto been shewn, had incouraged them to advance with the
greatest Boldness to the very Gates of their Towns; while they thought
they run no other Risque, but of being made Prisoners, where they live
better than at Home. He added, that the <i>Five Nations</i> having burnt so
many <i>French</i>, justified this Method of making Reprizals. But with
Submission to the Politeness of the <i>French</i> Nation, may I not ask,
whether every (or any) horrid Action of a barbarous Enemy, can justify a
civilized Nation in doing the like?</p>

<p>When the Governor could not be moved, the Jesuits went to the Prison, to
instruct the Prisoners in the Mysteries of our Holy Religion, <i>viz</i>. of
the Trinity, the Incarnation of our Saviour, the Joys of Paradise, and
the Punishments of Hell, to fit their Souls for Heaven by Baptism, while
their Bodies were condemned to Torments. But the <i>Indians</i>, after they
had heard their Sentence, refused to hear the Jesuits speak, and began
to prepare for Death in their own Country Manner, by singing their Death
Song.</p>

<p>Some charitable Person threw a Knife into the Prison, with which one of
them dispatched himself: The other was carried out to the Place of
Execution by the Christian <i>Indians</i> of <i>Loretto</i>, to which he walked,
seemingly, with as much Indifference as ever Martyr did to the Stake.
While they were torturing him, he continued singing, that he was a
Warrior brave and without Fear; that the most cruel Death could not
shake his Courage; that the most cruel Torment should not draw an
indecent Expression from him; that his Comrade was a Coward, a Scandal
to the <i>Five Nations</i>, who had killed himself for fear of Pain; that he
had the Comfort to reflect, that he had made many <i>Frenchmen</i> suffer as
he did now. He fully verified his Words, for the most violent Torment
could not force the least Complaint from him, though his Executioners
tried their utmost Skill to do it. They first broiled his Feet between
two red hot Stones; then they put his Fingers into red hot Pipes, and
though he had his Arms at Liberty, he would not pull his Fingers out;
they cut his Joints, and taking hold of the Sinews, twisted them round
small Bars of Iron. All this while he kept singing and recounting his
own brave Actions against the <i>French</i>. At last they flead his Scalp
from his Skull, and poured scalding hot Sand upon it; at which Time the
Intendant's Lady obtained Leave of the Governor to have the
<i>Coup-de-grace</i> given, and I believe she thereby likewise obtained a
Favour to every Reader, in delivering him from a further continuance of
this Account of <i>French</i> Cruelty.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this Cruelty, which the <i>French</i> Governor manifested
towards the <i>Five Nations</i>, and thereby his Hatred of them, he found
Peace with them so necessary to <i>Canada</i>, that he still pursued it by
all the Means in his Power. For this Purpose the <i>Praying Indians</i> (who,
as I observed before, are <i>Mohawks</i>, and have always kept a
Correspondence with their own Nation) were employed to bring it about,
and to endeavour a Cessation of Arms, that the Governor might have an
Opportunity of shewing what kind Things he had in his Heart towards the
<i>Five Nations</i>, but without Success.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_2_VIII" id="CHAP_2_VIII"></a>CHAP. VIII.</h2>

<h4><i>The</i> Five Nations <i>treat with Captain</i> Ingoldsby.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Governor of <i>New-York</i>, Colonel <i>Slaughter</i>'s Death, soon after his
Arrival, was very prejudicial to the Affairs of <i>New-York</i>; for Captain
<i>Ingoldsby</i>, who had no other Commission but that of Captain of one of
the Independent Companies of Foot, took upon himself the Government of
the Province, without any Authority; and he having likewise highly
offended a great Number of the People, by the Share he took in the late
Party Quarrels, it was not easy for him to prosecute any vigorous
Measures. He was reckoned to be much more a Soldier than a Statesman.</p>

<p>Captain <i>Ingoldsby</i> met the Five Nations at <i>Albany</i>, the sixth of
<i>June</i> 1692. In his Speech, he told them of his vigorous Resolutions to
prosecute the War, and then blamed them for not sending (according to
their Promise) a Party down <i>Cadarackui River</i>, to join them that went
from <i>Albany</i> against <i>Montreal</i>, and for their Carelesness in suffering
themselves to be surprised last Winter in their Hunting. He desired them
to keep the Enemy in perpetual Alarm, by the Incursions of their Parties
into the Enemy's Country, and to give him timely Notice of all their
Motions. He told them in the next Place, that he heard the <i>French</i> were
still using their wonted Artifice, of amusing them with Offers of Peace;
but the former Proceedings of the <i>French</i> sufficiently demonstrates,
said he to the Brethren, that while Peace is in their Mouths, War is in
their Hearts, and the late horrid Murder of the Brethren, after Quarter
given, sufficiently shews the Perfidy and Rancour of their Hearts. It is
in vain, said he, to think of any Cessation of Arms, much less of a
Peace, while the two Kings are at War at Home. He added, <i>Virginia</i> is
ready to assist us, and only waits the King's Orders, which are daily
expected, and then renewed the Chain for <i>Virginia</i>. In the last Place
he told them, that he heard the <i>Dionondadas</i> had sent two Prisoners
Home, with a View thereby to procure Peace; and advised them by all
Means to make Peace with that Nation.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> answered by <i>Cheda</i>, an <i>Oneydo Sachem:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Brother</i> Corlear,</p>

<p>The <i>Sachems</i> of the <i>Five Nations</i> have with great Attention heard
<i>Corlear</i> speak; we shall make a short Recital, to shew you with what
Care we have hearkened. After the Recital he continued.</p>

<p>We heartily thank <i>Corlear</i>, for his coming to this Place to view the
Strength thereof, for his bringing Forces with him, and for his
Resolution of putting Garisons into the Frontier Places. <b>Giving five
Bevers and a Belt.</b></p>

<p>Brother <i>Corlear</i>, as to what you blame us for, let us not reproach one
another, such Words do not favour well among Friends. They gave nothing
with this Article.</p>

<p>Brother <i>Corlear</i>, be patient under the Loss of your Men, as we are of
the <i>Mohawks</i> our Brethren, that were killed at the same Time. You take
no Notice of the great Losses we have suffered. We designed to have come
to this Place to have condoled with you in your Loss, but the War took
up all our Time, and employed all Hands. They <b>gave five Bevers, four
Otters, and one Belt</b>, as a Gift of Condolence.</p>

<p>Brother <i>Corlear</i>, we are all Subjects of one great King and Queen, we
have one Head, one Heart, one Interest, and are all ingaged in the same
War. You tell us, that we must expect no Peace while the Kings are at
War on the other Side the great Water. We thank you for being so plain
with us. We assure you we have no Thoughts of Peace. We are resolved to
carry on the War, though we know we only are in danger of being Losers.
Pray do you prosecute the War with the same Resolution. You are strong
and have many People. You have a great King, who is able to hold out
long. We are but a small People, and decline daily, by the Men we lose
in this War, we do our utmost to destroy the Enemy; but how strange does
it seem to us! How unaccountable! that while our great King is so
inveterate against the <i>French</i>, and you are so earnest with us to carry
on the War, that Powder is now sold dearer to us than ever? We are poor,
and not able to buy while we neglect hunting; and we cannot hunt and
carry on the War at the same Time: We expect, that this Evil we so
justly complain of be immediately remedied. <b>Giving nine Bevers.</b></p>

<p>Brother <i>Corlear</i>, you desire us to keep the Enemy in perpetual Alarm,
that they may have no Rest, till they are in their Graves; Is it not to
secure your own Frontiers? Why then not one Word of your People that are
to join us? We assure you we shall continue to carry on the War into the
Heart of the Enemies Country. <b>Giving eight Bevers.</b></p>

<p>We the <i>Five Nations</i>, <i>Mohawks</i>, <i>Oneydoes</i>, <i>Onondagas</i>, <i>Cayugas</i>,
and <i>Senekas</i>, renew the Silver Chain whereby we are linked fast with
our Brethren of <i>Assarigoa</i> (<i>Virginia</i>) and we promise to preserve it
as long as the Sun shall shine in the Heavens. <b>Giving ten Bevers.</b></p>

<p>But Brother <i>Corlear</i>, How comes it, that none of our Brethren fastened
in the same Chain with us, offer their helping Hand in this general War,
in which our great King is engaged against the <i>French</i>? Pray <i>Corlear</i>,
how come <i>Maryland</i>, <i>Delaware River</i>, and <i>New-England</i>, to be
disengaged from this War? You have always told us, that they are our
Brethren, Subjects of the same great King. Has our King sold them? Or do
they fail in their Obedience? Or do they draw their Arms out of our
Chain? Or has the great King commanded, that the few Subjects he has in
this Place, should make War against the <i>French</i> alone? Pray make plain
to us this Mystery? How can they and we be Brethren, and make different
Families? How can they and we be Subjects of the same great King, and
not be engaged in the same War? How can they and we have the same Heart,
the same Head, and the same Interest, as you tell us, and not have the
same Thoughts? How comes it, that the Enemy burns and destroys the Towns
in <i>New-England</i>, and they make no Resistance? How comes our great King
to make War, and not to destroy his Enemies? When, if he would only
command his Subjects on this Side the great Lake to joyn, the
Destruction of the Enemy would not make one Summer's Work.</p>

<p>You need not warn us of the Deceit and Treachery of the <i>French</i>, who
would probably insinuate Thoughts of Peace; but Brethren, you need not
fear us, we will never hearken to them: Tho' at the same Time, we must
own, that we have not been without Thoughts of your being inclined to
Peace, by Reason of the Brethren's Backwardness in pushing on the War.
The <i>French</i> spread Reports among us to this Purpose, and say, that they
had in a Manner concluded the Matter with you. We rejoice to be now
assured of this Falshood. We shall never desist fighting the <i>French</i> as
long as we shall live. And <b>gave a Belt of Wampum</b>.</p>

<p>We now renew the old Chain, and here plant the Tree of Prosperity and
Peace. May it grow and thrive, and spread its Roots even beyond
<i>Canada</i>. <b>Giving a Belt.</b></p>

<p>We make the House clean, where all our Affairs of Importance are
transacted with these five Otters.</p>

<p>We return you Thanks for the Powder and Lead given us; but what shall we
do with them without Guns, shall we throw them at the Enemy? We doubt
they will not hurt them so. Before this we always had Guns given us. It
is no Wonder the Governor of <i>Canada</i> gains upon us, for he supplies his
<i>Indians</i> with Guns as well as Powder; he supplies them plentifully with
every Thing that can hurt us. <b>Giving five Otters.</b></p>

<p>As to the <i>Dionondadas</i> setting two of our Nation at Liberty, we must
tell you, that it was not the Act of that Nation, but the private Act of
one Person: We are desirous to make Peace with that Nation as soon as we
can, upon honourable Terms. And <b>gave a Belt</b>.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Mohawks</i>, before they left the Place, desired a private Conference
with the Governor, and told him, that they were all exceedingly
dissatisfied, that the other <i>English</i> Colonies gave no Assistance, and
that it might prove of ill Consequence. Captain <i>Ingoldsby</i> promised to
write to them, and hoped it would have a good Effect.</p>

<h4><i>The</i> French <i>surprise and take three</i> Mohawk <i>Castles</i>.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he <i>Praying Indians</i> promised their Endeavours to reconcile their
Brethren the <i>Mohawks</i> to the <i>French</i>, on whom the <i>French</i> expected
they would have much Influence; but their Endeavours proving
ineffectual, their Correspondence began to be suspected. The <i>French</i>
thought they did more Hurt than Good, by the Intelligence the Enemy by
their Means received. The <i>French</i> in <i>Canada</i> began to lose their
Spirits, by being obliged to remain so long upon the defensive, as the
<i>Five Nations</i> gained more Courage by it. The Count <i>de Frontenac</i>
thought it therefore absolutely necessary to undertake some bold
Enterprize, to shew the <i>Five Nations</i>, that they had to do with an
Enemy still able to act offensively: An Attack on the <i>Mohawks</i> he
thought would be most effectual for this Purpose, because it would shew,
at the same Time, that the <i>English</i> would not protect their nearest
Neighbours. As this was designed to be done by Surprize, the Winter
Season was chosen for this Purpose, as least to be suspected at such a
Time; and when the Enemy could not, without great Hardship, keep Scouts
abroad, to discover them or the <i>English</i> give any Assistance.</p>

<p>The Body of the <i>French</i> designed for this Expedition was put under
three Captains of the regular Troops, and thirty Subalterns, and
consisted of picked Men of the regular Troops of the common Militia of
the Country of the <i>Praying Indians</i>, the <i>Quatoghies</i> of <i>Loretto</i>,
<i>Adirondacks</i>, and <i>Sohokies</i>, who live to the eastward of <i>Boston</i>,
making in all about six or seven hundred Men, so that a great Part of
the Force of <i>Canada</i> was employed in it. They were well supplied with
all Sorts of Ammunition, Provision, Snow-Shoes, and such Conveniencies
for Carriage, as were practicable upon the Snow, and through such great
Forests as they had to pass. The <i>French</i> at <i>Canada</i> have a Kind of
light Sledges made with Skins, and are drawn by large Dogs on the frozen
Snow.</p>

<p>They set out from <i>la Prairie de Magdeleine</i> the 15th of <i>January</i>
1692-3, after having endured what might have been thought unsurmountable
Hardships; they passed by <i>Schenectady</i> at some Distance from it, on the
8th of <i>February</i>, at which Time one that had been taken Prisoner, when
that Place was sacked, made his Escape from them, and gave the People of
<i>Schenectady</i> Intelligence of the <i>French</i>, who by an Express,
immediately informed the Commandant of <i>Albany</i>. The Millitia was
expeditiously raised, and a Lieutenant with fifty five Horse was
immediately dispatched to <i>Schenectady</i>; but no Care was taken to give
the <i>Mohawks</i> Notice, which might have been done without much Danger, by
sending up the South Side of the River, whilst the <i>French</i> marched on
the North. The <i>French</i>, on the 8th at Night, reached the first <i>Mohawk</i>
Castle, where there were only five Men, and some Women and Children in
great Security, their other Men being all abroad, these were all taken
without Opposition. The next Fort not far from it was in like Manner
surprized, without any Opposition, both of them were very small, and
being next the <i>English</i>, not fortified.</p>

<p><i>Schenectady</i> being the nearest <i>English</i> Settlement to the <i>Mohawks</i>,
and but a little Way from their nearest Castle, many of them are always
there. The <i>Mohawks</i> then in the Town were exceedingly enraged, that
none went out to assist their Nation; some were sent therefore out the
next Day, to gain Information of the Enemy, and to give the <i>Mohawks</i>
Notice; but they returned without doing their Duty.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> went on to the next <i>Mohawk</i> Fort, which was the largest;
and coming to that in the Night, they heard some Noise, and suspected
they were discovered: But this Noise was only occasioned by a War Dance,
forty of the <i>Indians</i> designing to go next Day upon some Enterprize.
The <i>French</i> approached the Castle silently, and finding the <i>Indians</i>
no way on their Guard, opened the Gate, and entered before they were
discovered; but notwithstanding this, and the Confusion the <i>Indians</i>
must be in, this Conquest was not without Loss of Blood, the <i>French</i>
having lost thirty Men, before the <i>Indians</i> entirely submitted: The
<i>French</i> designed to have put them all to the Sword, but their own
<i>Indians</i> would not suffer it, and gave Quarter: They took three hundred
Prisoners, of whom one hundred were fighting Men. I have no Account of
the Number of <i>Mohawks</i> killed, but no Doubt it was very considerable.</p>

<p>When the Account came to <i>Albany</i>, how much the <i>Mohawks</i>, who were at
<i>Schenectady</i>, were enraged, that no Assistance was sent to their
Countrymen; <i>Peter Schuyler</i> a Major of the Militia offered himself to
go with what Force could be got ready for their Assistance. He went
himself immediately to <i>Schenectady</i>, and sent out to discover the
Enemy: His Scouts brought him Intelligence, first, that the <i>French</i>
were in Possession of the two smallest Forts, afterwards, that they had
heard great Firing at the largest Fort; and at last, that it was taken.
Having received 200 Men, partly regular Troops, but most of the Militia,
he began his March on the 12th in Quest of the Enemy; but hearing soon
after, that six hundred Men of the upper Castles were on their March,
'tis probable he did not endeavour to be up with the <i>French</i> so soon as
he might; for I find by his Journal, that he was nearer them on the
fourteenth, than he was two Days after. He had not sufficient Force to
fight them: He sent therefore to the upper <i>Indians</i>, to hasten their
March. On the 15th he was joined by these <i>Indians</i>, in all two hundred
and ninety Men and Boys, very ill armed. His Body then consisted of two
hundred and fifty Christians, and two hundred and ninety <i>Indians</i>,
armed fighting Men. They had no other Provision but some Biscuit every
Man had in his Pocket. On the 16th he was informed by an <i>Indian</i>, who
pretended to be a Deserter, that the <i>French</i> had built a Fort, where
they designed to wait for him, and fight him; whereupon he sent an
Express to Coll. <i>Ingoldesby</i>, then Commandant at <i>Albany</i>, to hasten
more Men to join him, with sufficient Provision for the whole. He found
afterwards, that this <i>Indian</i> was sent by the French, on purpose to
persuade the <i>Indians</i> to give over the Pursuit. Major <i>Schuyler</i> came
up to the Enemy on the 17th; when he came near them he did not go on
streight towards them, for Fear of Ambuscades, but marched round. As
soon as he came in Sight, he was saluted with three loud Shouts, which
were answered with as much Noise. The <i>Indians</i> began in their Manner to
secure themselves, by felling the Trees between them, and the Enemy
sallied out to prevent them, but were soon beat back. The <i>Indians</i> fell
to Work again, and desired the Christians to assist them, which was
done, but in such Confusion, that they themselves were in Danger from
the falling Trees. The <i>French</i> sallied a second Time with all their
Force, crying out, <i>They run, we'll cut them off, and get their
Provisions</i>; but they were warmly received, and beat back into their
Fort. They sallied a third Time, and were beat back with considerable
Loss, the <i>Indians</i> bringing in several Heads and Scalps. As soon as the
Skirmishing was over, the Major sent back an Express, to hasten the Men
that were to reinforce him, and were to bring Provision, some of the Men
having had no Provision for two Days. The <i>Major</i> then secured himself,
under the Cover of the fallen Trees, and kept out Watches to observe the
<i>French</i>.</p>

<p>The 18th proving a cold stormy Day, with Snow, he was informed, by a
Deserter, that the <i>French</i> were upon their March, it not being easy to
follow their Tracks, or to discover them in such Weather. The Officers
were commanded to pursue and retard their March, till the Reinforcement
should come up, but the Men refused to march without Provision. The
Officers, with about 60 Men, and a Body of <i>Indians</i>, followed the Enemy
till Night, when they began to secure themselves, by fortifying their
Camp. The Officers wanting a sufficient Number to secure themselves in
like Manner, or to sight the Enemy, returned, leaving about forty
Christians, and one hundred <i>Indians</i>, to observe them. On the 19th the
Provisions, with about 80 Men, arrived, under the Command of Captain
<i>Sims</i> of the regular Troops. Every Man, as he was served with
Provision, marched towards the Enemy. The Van was commanded by Captain
<i>Peter Matthews</i> of the regular Troops, who coming up with the Enemy's
Rear, would have attacked them, to retard their March, but the <i>Mohawks</i>
were averse to fighting. The French dropt on purpose several of their
Prisoners, who told the <i>Mohawks</i>, that the <i>French</i> were resolved to
put all the Prisoners to the Sword, if they should be attacked. The
Enemy passed the North Branch of <i>Hudson</i>'s River upon a Cake of Ice,
which, very opportunely for them, stuck there in one Place, while it was
open by a late Thaw, both above and below. The Weather continuing very
cold, and the <i>Indians</i> averse to fighting, Major <i>Schuyler</i> gave over
the Pursuit on the 20th, having lost only four private Men, and as many
<i>Indians</i>, two Officers and twelve Men Christians and <i>Indians</i> were
wounded. The <i>French</i> lost thirty three Men (the Bodies of twenty seven
were found) of whom four were Officers, and twenty-six wounded, as the
Deserters told him. Between forty and fifty Prisoners were recovered. I
have been told, that Captain <i>Matthews</i> desired Coll. <i>Schuyler</i>, when
he came first up with the <i>French</i>, to summon them to surrender; he
said, the <i>French</i> are in great Distress, and this will give them an
Opinion of our Strength; but Coll. <i>Schuyler</i> refused, tho' he was
brave, he was no Soldier; and it is very probable, that the <i>French</i>
observing the want of Conduct and Discipline, were encouraged. It is
true, the <i>English</i> were in great Want of Provisions at that Time. The
<i>Indians</i> eat the Bodies of the <i>French</i> that they found. Coll.
<i>Schuyler</i> (as he told me himself) going among the <i>Indians</i> at that
Time, was invited to eat Broth with them, which some of them had ready
boiled, which he did, till they, putting the Ladle into the Kettle to
take out more, brought out a <i>French</i> Man's Hand, which put an End to
his Appetite.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> went home as fast as they could carry their wounded Men
with them; but coming to a Place, where they had hid Provisions for
their Supply in their return, they found it all spoiled. This put them
in great Distress, so that they were forced to eat their Shoes; they
sent some of the nimblest Men forward to <i>Montreal</i>, that Provision
might meet them. As soon as they came near the Settlements they
dispersed, every Man running home to eat, so that they returned to
<i>Canada</i> like an Army routed. The <i>French</i> own they lost eighty Men, and
had thirty three wounded in this Expedition.</p>

<p>One may wonder how it is possible for Men to march several hundred Miles
in the Wilderness, while the Ground is every where covered with Snow,
two or three Feet deep at least; but the foremost march on Snow Shoes,
which beat a firm Track for those that follow. At Night, when they rest,
they dig a Hole in the Snow, throwing the Snow up all round, but highest
towards that Side from whence the Wind blows, so large, as to contain as
many Men as can lye round a Fire: They make the Fire in the Middle, and
cover the frozen Ground round it with the small Branches of the
Fir-Trees. Thus they tell me a Man lyes much warmer, than one imagines
that never tried it.</p>

<p>When the Information of the <i>French</i> came to <i>Schenectady</i>, an Express
was sent to <i>New-York</i> to Coll. <i>Fletcher</i> then Governor there; the
Express reached <i>New-York</i>, an hundred and fifty Miles from <i>Albany</i>,
the 12th at ten in the Night. The Governor got the City Regiment under
Arms by eight the next Morning.</p>

<p>He called out to know who were willing to go with him to the Frontiers,
they all immediately threw up their Hats, and answered one and all.
Indeed the People of this Province have, upon all Occasions, shewn
their Courage and Resolution in Defence of their Country; but the
Misfortune is, they are under no Discipline, and have been seldom led by
Men that knew their Duty. The Governor ordered an hundred and fifty
Voluntiers for this Service, and as many more from <i>Long-Island</i>. The
River then happened to be open by a sudden Thaw, which does not, at that
Time of the Year, happen once in twenty Years. He embarked three hundred
Men in five Sloops, by four in the Afternoon of the 14th, and arrived at
<i>Albany</i> the 17th at nine in the Morning. The same Day the Governor went
to <i>Schenectady</i>, and ordered the Men to follow, but before they could
get every Thing ready for their March into the Woods, they had an
Account, that Major <i>Schuyler</i> was upon his Return. Several Gentlemen of
<i>Albany</i>, particularly Mr. <i>Lanslear</i>, a Gentleman of the best Estate
there, went out Voluntiers under Major <i>Schuyler</i>, which I ought not to
have forgot.</p>

<p>Coll. <i>Fletcher</i> made a Speech to the <i>Mohawks</i> at <i>Albany</i>, he blamed
their supine Negligence, in suffering themselves to be surprised in the
Manner they were in Time of War. He told them that they had Reason to be
convinced, that the <i>English</i> were their Friends heartily, by the Number
of Men he had marched to their Assistance in a very little Time, upon
the first Notice. He promised to wipe away their Tears in the Spring, by
considerable Presents; and that he would, in the mean while, take Care
of their Subsistence, by providing Houses and Victuals for them. He told
them, he doubted they had some false Brethren among them, that gave the
<i>French</i> Information, and favoured their Designs; and in the last Place,
advised them to convince the <i>French</i>, that they had not lost their
Courage with this Misfortune.</p>

<p>The <i>Mohawks</i>, in their Answer, called Coll. <i>Fletcher</i> by the Name of
<i>Cayenguirago</i>; and he was called so by the <i>Indians</i> always after
this. It signifies <i>a great swift Arrow</i>, as an Acknowledgement of the
Speed he made to their Assistance. But they appeared, in their Answer,
to be quite disheartned; they had not, in the Memory of any Man,
received such a Blow. They said their Strength was quite broke, by the
Continuance of the War; but they added, if all the <i>English</i> Colonies
would join, they could still easily take <i>Canada</i>: Their being so ill
armed, was the Reason (they said) that the <i>French</i> had now escaped.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i>, continued they, arm their <i>Indians</i> compleatly, and
furnish them with every Thing necessary for War, as we find every Time
we meet with them.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> had got a great Quantity of Furs, and other Peltry, at
<i>Missilimakinak</i>, by their Trade with the <i>Indians</i>; but the <i>Five
Nations</i> had so effectually blocked up the Passage between that and
<i>Canada</i>, that they had remained there useless to the <i>French</i> for
several Years. The Count <i>de Frontenac</i>, after his Success against the
<i>Mohawks</i>, was in Hopes the <i>Five Nations</i> would keep more at home in
Defence of their own Castles, and with these Hopes sent a Lieutenant,
with eighteen <i>Canadians</i>, and twenty <i>praying Indians</i>, to open the
Passage to <i>Missilimakinak</i>; but this Party fell in with another of the
<i>Five Nations</i>, who entirely routed them, so that a few escaped only, to
give an Account of their Misfortune; at last 200 Canoes, loaded with
Furs from <i>Missilimakinak</i>, arrived at <i>Montreal</i>, which gave as
universal a Joy to <i>Canada</i>, as the Arrival of the <i>Galleons</i> give in
<i>Spain</i>.</p>

<h4><i>The Treaties and Negotiations the</i> Five Nations <i>had with the</i> English
<i>and</i> French, <i>in the Years</i> 1693 <i>and</i> 1694.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>s by this Time the Reader may be tired with the horrid Scenes of a
barbarous War, it may be some Relief to observe the <i>Indian</i> Genius in
the Arts of negotiating; and see how a barbarous People, without any of
the Arts and Sciences in which we value our selves, manage their
Interest with the most learned, most polite, and artificial Nation in
<i>Europe</i>. The <i>Five Nations</i> were informed, that the Governor of
<i>Canada</i> had received from <i>Europe</i> a very considerable Recruit of
Soldiers, and of all Sorts of Ammunition. This, with the great Loss the
<i>Mohawks</i> had lately suffered, while they had been amused by the
<i>English</i> with great Hopes, and very little real Assistance, made the
<i>Oneydoes</i>, at last yield to the Solicitations of the Jesuit <i>Milet</i>, to
send a Message to the <i>French</i> for Peace. It is probable he had the Art
to influence the People at <i>Albany</i> to favour his Designs, by giving
them Hopes of being included in the Peace, as may be conjectured, from
what will appear in the Sequel.</p>

<p>Coll. <i>Fletcher</i> being informed, that the <i>Oneydoes</i> had sent a
Messenger to <i>Canada</i>, sent for the <i>Five Nations</i> to <i>Albany</i>. He spoke
to them the third of <i>July</i> 1693.</p>

<p>He first excused his not meeting them as he had promised, at the Time
the Sap begins to run in the Trees, by Reason of his having received a
Commission to be Governor of <i>Pensilvania</i>, to which Place he was
obliged at that Time to go. He put them in Mind with what Speed he came
to their Assistance last Winter, and how effectual, in all Probability,
it would have been, had they only retarded the Enemy's March till he
could have reached them: He advised them to guard against being drunk,
and shewed them the ill Consequences of it in Time of War.</p>

<p>Then he said, "I have received Information, that some of the Brethren
are wavering, and inclined to Peace with the Enemy; and am assured,
that such Thoughts must arise from the Instigation of the Jesuit
<i>Milet</i>, whom some of the Brethren have suffered to live so long among
them, and whose only Practice is to delude and betray them. Let me
therefore advise you to remove that ill Person from among you."</p>

<p>In the End he condoled their Dead, and made them a very considerable
Present of ninety Guns, eight hundred and ten Pound of Powder, eight
hundred Bars of Lead, a Thousand Flints, eighty seven Hatchets, four
Gross of Knives, besides a considerable Quantity of Cloathing and
Provisions. This Present, he told them, their King and Queen had sent
them, and renewed the Covenant for all the <i>English</i> Colonies.</p>

<p>The King usually sends them a considerable Present with every new
Governor sent to <i>New-York</i>, which is not always applied as it is
designed. If this Present had been made sooner, it had been of much more
Use to the <i>English</i>, as well as to the <i>Five Nations</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i> the next Day spoke as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>,</p>

<p>"We are involved in a bloody War, which makes us sit in Sorrow
and Grief; and being about to speak of Matters of Importance,
we, in the first Place, clear the Mouth and Throat of our
Interpretess, by <b>giving her these three Bever Skins</b>."</p></div>

<p>Then they repeated his Excellency's Speech, in Answer to which they
said,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, we rejoice, that the great King and
Queen of <i>England</i> take such Notice of us, as we find, by the
large Present sent us; we return hearty Thanks for the
Ammunition especially.</p>

<p>"We are glad that our Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i> renews the Chain,
not only between us and this Government, but likewise with
<i>New-England</i>, <i>Virginia</i>, <i>Maryland</i> and <i>Pensilvania</i>; it
shall be kept inviolable by us the <i>Five Nations</i>, as long as
the Sun shines. We pray our Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i> to have a
watchful Eye, that none of the other Colonies keep any
Correspondence with the Enemy, but use their Endeavours to
destroy them. We heard nothing of what you told us of the Priest
<i>Milet</i>, who lives at <i>Oneydo</i>, till we came to this Town. We
have enquired the Truth of our Brethren the <i>Oneydoes</i>, who
confess, that the Priest sent an <i>Indian</i> to <i>Canada</i> with
Letters, which has surprised us very much.</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, you are our great Tree, whose Roots
extend to the utmost Bounds of this Government; we desire you
may not be disturbed when any of our Prisoners misbehave, for
they are not countenanced by us; and all proper Methods shall be
taken, to prevent the like for the future. In like Manner we beg
you to take Care, that none of the Prisoners you have correspond
with the Enemy, as we suspect the Chevalier <i>D'O</i>. did; and that
he was sent with Letters to <i>Canada</i> by some of our Brethren.
(He made his Escape from <i>Boston</i>.)</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, In former Times our Propositions to one
another were only Discourses of Peace and Friendship, and in
giving Presents; but how much is the Case altered of late? Now
we talk of nothing but War, and are continually prompting one
another to it. As to our Parts, we will keep close to the War to
the last Drop of our Blood; and tho' we be tossed to and fro
with Storms, we will remain stedfast to the last Man, as it was
resolved by both in the Beginning of the War.</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, we were told in our own Country, not
only that the King had made you Governor of <i>Pensilvania</i>, but
likewise that you were preparing a Fleet to take <i>Canada</i>. O!
what joyful News this was to our young Men. <i>Sadagarus</i>, the
great <i>Seneka</i> Captain, was to command them. Now they said, we
need only make one hearty Push, while the Fleet is before
<i>Quebeck</i>. Now there will be an End to this bloody War, and all
our Troubles; But alas, now we are come here, we hear not one
Word of this Design.</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, you are that flourishing Tree that
covers us; you keep the Chain bright; we have one Request to
make to you, that you may stay with us, and not return to
<i>England</i>; for you know our Ways and Manners. If you have any
Thing to tell the King and Queen, write it to them, for the King
knows you to be a wise Man, and will therefore believe you.</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, we are very glad to hear that
<i>Pensilvania</i> is come under your Government, bring their young
Men here, with their Bows and Arrows and Hatchets in their
Hands, for this is the Place of Action. We are pleased that the
<i>Showonons</i> or <i>Satanas</i>, who are our Enemies, have applied to
you for Protection; and that you sent them to us to endeavour a
Peace, and that you sent Christians with them, to conduct them
back again. We wish they were come to assist us against the
common Enemy.</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, now we have done, but must tell you
again, that we roll and wallow in Joy, by Reason of the great
Favour the great King and Queen has done us, in sending us Arms
and Ammunition, at a Time when we are in the greatest Need of
them; and because there is such Unity among the Brethren."</p></div>

<p>They made the Governor a considerable Present of Furs, to shew their
Respect to his Person; but they did not give one Belt to confirm any one
Article; so that the whole of it is, according to their Stile, only
argumentative.</p>

<p>Coll. <i>Fletcher</i> not being satisfied with their Answer, concerning the
Jesuit <i>Milet</i>, made this further Proposal to them. "As to <i>Milet</i> the
Priest, whom the Brethren of <i>Oneydo</i> still harbour among them, I must
tell you again, that he betrays you, and all your Councils; and that you
may see I desire not to diminish your Number, I am willing to give you a
pretty <i>Indian</i> Boy, in Lieu of the old Priest; and accordingly the Boy
was brought and delivered to them."</p>

<p>In answer to this the <i>Oneydo Sachem</i> said, "As soon as the <i>Indian</i>
Messenger returns all his Papers shall be taken from him, and be
forthwith brought to our Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, before the Priest shall
see any of them: we are willing to take the Boy in Exchange for the
Priest, but it is not safe to do it, while our Messenger is in the Power
of the Enemy; let the Boy stay here till we bring the Priest, which
shall be as soon as the Messenger shall return". But he gave no Belt, or
other Present, to confirm this Promise. He added,</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, we now acquaint you that it is proposed by all
the <i>Five Nations</i>, to make Peace with the <i>Dionondadies</i>, a Nation of
<i>Indians</i> near in Alliance with the <i>French</i> of <i>Canada</i>. This will both
strengthen us and weaken the Enemy. The <i>Senekas</i>, who live nearest
them, have undertaken this Treaty, and take Belts of Wampum from the
other Nations, to confirm the Peace. We desire your Approbation, that
you would send your Belt in Concurrence, as our eldest Brother in our
Chain."</p>

<p>The Governor approved of this, and <b>gave them a Belt</b> to carry in his
Name.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what the Speaker of the <i>Five Nations</i> had promised to
the Governor, to bring all the Papers the <i>Oneydo</i> Messenger should
bring from <i>Canada</i>, before the Jesuit <i>Milet</i> should have Liberty to
see them, it could not be difficult for the Jesuit, to persuade them to
keep the Power of making Peace in their own Hands, and for that Purpose,
to call a Meeting of the <i>Sachems</i> of <i>Onondago</i>, where all such Matters
had been formerly transacted among themselves, and there to determine
independently, rather than to submit themselves to another Nation at
<i>Albany</i>. They only invited the <i>English</i> to assist at the general
Council. The <i>English</i> used what Arguments they could to dissuade this
Meeting, but rather to observe the Promise made to the Governor; and it
seems used some Threatning. The <i>Mohawks</i> had so much Regard to the
<i>English</i>, that they refused to assist at the Council. The other four,
notwithstanding this, met, and resolved on an Answer to be sent to the
Governor of <i>Canada</i>; but at the same Time, to shew their Regard to the
<i>Mohawks</i> and <i>English</i>, these Resolutions were not to be final, till
they should first be communicated to the <i>English</i> and <i>Mohawks</i>, and
their Advice received thereon; for which Purpose several <i>Sachems</i> were
sent to <i>Albany</i>, of whom <i>Decanesora</i> was the Principal and the
Speaker.</p>

<p><i>Decanesora</i> had for many Years the greatest Reputation among the <i>Five
Nations</i> for speaking, and was generally employed as their Speaker, in
their Negotiations with both <i>French</i> and <i>English</i>: He was grown old
when I saw him, and heard him speak; he had a great Fluency in speaking,
and a graceful Elocution, that would have pleased in any Part of the
World. His Person was tall and well made, and his Features, to my
thinking, resembled much the Bustos of <i>Cicero</i>. I shall give an Account
of these Negotiations from <i>Decanesora</i>'s Mouth, because his Narration
agrees in the main with the Account the <i>French</i> give of them, and
carries along with it as strong Evidences of Truth, as that of the
<i>French</i> do: but the chief Reason is, that I intend to give the Reader
as perfect a Notion as I can of the <i>Indian</i> Genius; and here it will
appear, what Art <i>Decanesora</i> had, to make an Account of an Affair less
disagreeable to <i>English</i> Ears, which had been undertaken against their
Advice, and contrary to their Interest.</p>

<p><i>Decanesora</i> spoke to Major <i>Schuyler</i> (<i>Quider</i>) and the Magistrates of
<i>Albany</i>, the second of <i>February</i> 1693-4 as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, we are come to acquaint you, that
our Children the <i>Oneydoes</i> having of themselves sent a
Messenger to <i>Canada</i>, he has brought back with him a Belt of
Peace from the Governor of <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>"As soon as <i>Tariha</i> (the Messenger) arrived at <i>Canada</i>, he was
asked, where the six hundred Men were that were to attack
<i>Canada</i>, as they had been informed by <i>Cariokese</i> a <i>Mohawk</i>
Deserter? He assured them there was no such Design.</p>

<p>"He was carried to <i>Quebeck</i>, where he delivered his Belt, with
the following Propositions. <i>Onondio</i>, if you would have Peace
go to <i>Albany</i>, and ask it there, for the <i>Five Nations</i> will do
nothing without <i>Cayenguirago</i>. The Governor of <i>Canada</i> was
angry at this, and said, he had nothing to do with the Governor
of <i>New-York</i>, he would treat only with the <i>Five Nations</i>; the
Peace between the Christians must be made on the other Side the
great Lake. He added, he was sorry to see the <i>Five Nations</i> so
far degenerated, as to take a sixth Nation into their Chain, to
rule over them. If you had desired me to come and treat in any
of your Castles, I would have done it; but to tell me I must go
to <i>Albany</i>, is to desire of me what I can by no Means do. You
have done very ill, to suffer the People of <i>New-York</i> to
govern you so far, that you dare do nothing without their
Consent. I advise you to send two of each Nation to me, and let
<i>Decanesora</i> be one of them. I have Orders from the King my
Master to grant you Peace, if you come in your proper Persons to
ask it. The Governor of <i>Canada</i> afterwards said,</p>

<p>"Children of the <i>Five Nations</i>, I have Compassion for your
little Children, therefore come speedily, and speak of Peace to
me, otherwise I'll stop my Ears for the future: By all Means let
<i>Decanesora</i> come; for if the <i>Mohawks</i> come alone, I will not
hear them, some of all the <i>Five Nations</i> must come. Now
<i>Tariha</i> return home, and tell the <i>Five Nations</i>, that I will
wait for their coming till the Trees bud, and the Bark can be
parted from the Trees. I design for <i>France</i> in the Spring, and
I leave a Gentleman to command here, to whom I have given Orders
to raise Soldiers, if you do not come in that Time, and then
what will become of you? I am truly grieved to see the <i>Five
Nations</i> so debauched and deceived by <i>Cayenguirago</i>, who is
lately come to <i>New-York</i>, and by <i>Quider</i>. Formerly the chief
Men of the <i>Five Nations</i> used to converse with me; but this
Governor of <i>New-York</i> has so deluded you, that you hearken to
none but him; but take Care of what will follow, if you hearken
to none but him."</p></div>

<p>Then <i>Decanesora</i> excused the not sending the Letters to <i>Albany</i>, which
came by <i>Tariha</i>, as they had promised, saying, the other Nations
trusted this to the <i>Oneydoes</i>, because the Messenger was to return to
them, and the <i>Oneydoes</i> deceived the others. He likewise excused their
not coming to <i>Albany</i> as soon as <i>Tariha</i> returned, which was in
<i>November</i>. He said the chief <i>Sachem</i> of the <i>Onondagas</i>, who was
entrusted (as their Speaker) by the <i>Five Nations</i> with their general
Affairs, by the general Council of <i>Onondaga</i>, had a sore Leg, and could
not travel<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<p>That in such Case he (<i>Decanesora</i>) did all that was in his Power, that
is, he called a Council at <i>Onondaga</i>, to give Directions in this
Affair; and that he invited <i>Quider</i> to this Council. He continued,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The four Nations that met there resolved to send Deputies to
<i>Canada</i>, and that I <i>Decanesora</i> was to be one of them; but at
the same Time ordered me, with some others, to communicate the
Resolutions of the General Council to our Brethren at <i>Albany</i>,
and to the <i>Mohawks</i>, to be farther advised by them.</p>

<p>"The Resolutions are, to <b>send three Belts</b> to the Governor of
<i>Canada</i>, with the following Propositions.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"I. <i>Onondio</i>, you have sent for me often, and as often asked,
why I am afraid to come? The great Kettle of War that you have
hung over the Fire is the Reason of it. Then laying down the
first Belt, I am to ask his Consent to the other two Belts which
I still keep in my Hand.</p>

<p>"II. We now not only throw down the Kettle, and thereby throw
the boiling Water out of it, but likewise break it to Pieces,
that it may never be hanged up again by this second Belt.</p>

<p>"III. Hearken, <i>Onondio</i>, you are sent from the <i>French</i> King,
your Master, as <i>Cayenguirago</i> is from the great King and Queen
of <i>England</i>. What I am now about to speak to you, is by
Inspiration from the great God of Heaven. You say that you will
have nothing to do with our Brethren of <i>Cayenguirago</i>, but I
must tell you, that we are inseparable, we can have no Peace
with you so long as you are at War with them; we must stand and
fall with them; which I am to confirm, by laying down the third
Belt.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"When this was concluded the Jesuit <i>Milet</i>, and another
<i>French</i> Gentleman (who had been taken Prisoner, and was taken
into the Place of the chief <i>Sachem of Onondaga</i>, formerly lost
in the War, and thereby became a <i>Sachem</i>) desired Leave to add
two Belts to the other three. By their being <i>Sachems</i> they had
a Vote in the General Council, and a Right to propose any Thing.
They wrote and read to us the Purports of their Belts, and we
have brought their Papers with us, to shew to our Brethren."</p></div>

<p>To shew the Necessity they were under of making Peace, speedily he
added:</p>

<p>"That two Women, who were Prisoners at <i>Canada</i>, had made their Escape,
on Purpose to inform them that the <i>French</i> were making great
Preparations of Battoes, and other Necessaries for an Expedition; one
said, she had informed one of the <i>Sachems</i> of the <i>Praying Indians</i> of
her Design, who sent an <i>Indian</i> with her to advise the <i>Five Nations</i>,
to prevent the great Danger they were threatened with by a speedy
Conclusion of the Peace; and added, that they had sent one of their
People back with this <i>Praying Indian</i>, to assure them that Deputies
would certainly go to <i>Canada</i> in the Spring to treat of Peace." I make
no Doubt, this was only an Article to hasten the <i>Five Nations</i> to
conclude the Peace, lest the <i>English</i>, if it were delayed, should find
Means to prevent it. Then he shewed the Flag which the Governor of
<i>Canada</i> sent them to be carried by their Deputies, that the <i>French</i>
might know them. Upon these Resolutions being taken, the <i>Five Nations</i>
recalled six hundred Men, that they had placed along <i>Cadarackui River</i>,
to intercept the <i>French</i>, as they passed to and from <i>Missilimakinak</i>.</p>

<p>The Jesuit's Papers being read to them, several Things were found in
them which he had not read to the General Council. To this <i>Decanesora</i>
answered; "We know that the Priest favours his own Nation, and deceives
us in many Things; but it is not in his Power to alter our Affection to
our Brethren, we wish you would bury all Misunderstandings that you have
conceived on his Account; and we likewise wish you gave less Credit to
the Rum-Carriers than you do."</p>

<p>Here we see, by this Appellation, what a contemptible Character the
Traders have among the <i>Indians</i>, and yet the Government of <i>New-York</i>
has almost perpetually trusted the Management of the <i>Indian</i> Affairs to
these Traders.</p>

<p><i>Decanesora</i> ended his Conference as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Governor of <i>Canada</i>'s Words, and the Resolutions of the
four Nations are now before you, consult therefore what is to be
done, and if it be necessary for the Brethren to go to our
Castles to advise us farther, be not unwilling; and then he laid
down a large Belt eleven Rows deep, and seven Fathom of Wampum."</p></div>

<p>The next Day Major <i>Schuyler</i> told them that he could consent to no
Treaty with the <i>French</i>; but proposed to them to meet the Governor here
in seventy Days, and that <i>Decanesora</i> in particular should return at
that Time, and gave a Belt.</p>

<p>They agreed to meet the Governor at that Time;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But as for myself (says <i>Decanesora</i>) I cannot promise; I am
now the Minister of the General Council, and cannot dispose of
myself, but by their Directions; if they order me, I shall
willingly return. We did not expect to hear such positive
Prohibition of keeping any Correspondence with the <i>French</i>;
seventy Days must pass before we meet again, if any Mischief be
done by the Enemy in that Time, let us not blame one another.
Consider again what is most for the publick Good, and let it be
spoken before we part, and laid down a large Belt of fourteen
deep."</p></div>

<p>Major <i>Schuyler</i> then asked them again, whether they promised to stop
all Correspondence with the <i>French</i>, either by the Jesuit or otherwise,
for seventy Days, and till they shall have his Excellency the Governor's
Answer.</p>

<p><i>Decanesora</i> answered to this, "I have no Authority to answer this
Question. I shall lay the Belt down in every one of the Castles, and
tell, that by it all Correspondence is desired to stop with the
<i>French</i>; but I cannot promise that this will be complied with."</p>

<p>Major <i>Schuyler</i> on the sixth called the <i>Indians</i> again together: He
advised them not to submit to, nor trust such a perfidious Nation as the
<i>French</i> are, who have upon all Occasions proved themselves such. Be not
discouraged, (says he, <b>giving a Belt</b>) Heaven begins again to favour us.
This Day the Forerunners of the <i>Shawonons</i> are come to Town, seven
Nations are on their March following them, one Thousand in Number,
including Men, Women and Children, as you may learn from their own
Mouths. Take Courage, and be not afraid, <b>giving five Fathom of Wampum</b>.
This seemed a lucky Incident, and accordingly it had more Influence than
all other Arguments together.</p>

<p><i>Decanesora</i>, the next Day, called the Magistrates together, and told
them, you have at last shut up the Way to <i>Canada</i>, but we have one
Thing to ask, after mature Deliberation, which we expect will not be
refused us. Major <i>Schuyler</i> assured them that every Thing should be
granted, which was either for their Safety or Honour. We desire then,
said he, that you send a Messenger along with ours to the <i>Praying
Indians</i> at <i>Canada</i>, to tell them that the Priest is false; that we
are to meet <i>Cayenguirago</i> in the Spring, and therefore cannot go to
<i>Canada</i> at that Time; and that a further Cessation of Arms be agreed
to, till such Time as we can go. We desire at least, that if you will
not send a Messenger, that you put the Message in Writing, as a Token of
your Assent to it. This last was agreed to, and the Message was put in
Writing in the following Words, and translated into <i>French</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The <b>Dispatch of three Belts</b>, which two Messengers of the <i>Five Nations</i>
carry to the <i>Caraguists</i> and Catholick <i>Indians</i>, according to what was
resolved by the <i>Agayandres</i> or <i>Sachems</i> of the <i>Five Nations</i>, at
<i>Albany</i>, <i>February</i> the ninth 1694.</p>

<h4>
<i>First Belt</i>.<br />
</h4>

<p>The <i>Agayandres</i> of the <i>Five Nations</i> cannot go to <i>Canada</i> in the
Spring, as they gave Reason to expect by the last Message from
<i>Onondaga</i>, because <i>Cayenguirago</i> has called all the <i>Five Nations</i>,
and other <i>Indians</i>, to meet him at <i>Albany</i>, in the Month of <i>April</i>
next, to which the <i>Five Nations</i> have agreed.</p>

<h4>
<i>Second Belt</i>.<br />
</h4>

<p>If the <i>Caraguists</i>, or <i>French</i>, have any Thing to propose to the <i>Five
Nations</i>, they may safely come into our Country. This Belt opens the
Path, and secures it to them both coming and going.</p>

<h4>
<i>Third Belt</i>.<br />
</h4>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i>, and their Friends, lay down the Hatchet till they
shall have an Answer, which they expect in forty Days. Provided
nevertheless, that the <i>Caraguists</i> and <i>French</i> tye their Hatchets down
at the same Time.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>These Belts were accordingly presented to the <i>Praying Indians</i> of
<i>Cahnuaga</i>, who refused to receive them but in the Presence of Mr. <i>de
Callieres</i>, Governor of <i>Montreal</i>. Mr. <i>de Callieres</i> acquainted the
Count <i>de Frontenac</i> with the Contents. After which the <i>Praying
Indians</i>, in Presence of Mr. <i>de Callieres</i>, gave the following Answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We will have no Correspondence with the <i>Five Nations</i>, but by
Order of the Governor of <i>Canada</i> our Father, and unless
<i>Decanesora</i>, and the other Deputies, come before the Feast of
St. <i>John</i>, the Way will be shut up for ever after, and our
Father's Ears will be stopt. We however assure you, that if the
Deputies come in that Time the Path shall be safe both coming
and going."</p></div>

<p>Whether the Accounts given of the coming of the <i>Shawonons</i> was only an
Amusement, or whether they were diverted on their March, I know not, for
I find no farther Account of them in the Register of the <i>Indian</i>
Affairs: However it was, the Impression made on the <i>Indians</i> by that
News, was not sufficient to withstand the Force of the resolute Answer
their Messenger received from the <i>Praying Indians</i>. <i>Decanesora</i> and
the other Deputies went early in the Spring to <i>Canada</i>; the other
<i>Sachems</i> met Colonel <i>Fletcher</i> at <i>Albany</i>, the fourth of <i>May</i> 1694.
The <i>Indians</i> spoke first by <i>Sadakanahtie</i>, an <i>Onondaga Sachem</i>, as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Brother</i> Cayenguirago,</p>

<p>"Some of our <i>Sachems</i> agreed last Winter that we should keep no
Correspondence with the <i>French</i>; we confess that we have broke
that Promise, and that we have received a Messenger from
<i>Canada</i>, and have sent our Deputies likewise thither. The Belt
is not yet arrived, by which we are to acknowledge our Fault in
doing this. The Reason of our doing it is truly this, we are
afraid of the Enemy.</p>

<p>"When a Messenger came last Year from <i>Canada</i> to <i>Onondaga</i>,
our Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i> discharged our Meeting in General
Council at <i>Onondaga</i>, to consult on that Message, and ordered
us to hold our General Council here at <i>Albany</i> on that Affair.
The Privilege of meeting in General Council, when we please, is
a Privilege we always have enjoyed; no former Governor, of the
Name of <i>Corlear</i>, ever obstructed this Privilege. We planted a
Tree of Peace in this Place with them, its Roots and Branches
extend as far as <i>Virginia</i> and <i>New-England</i>, and we have
reposed with Pleasure under its Shade. Brother, let us keep to
that first Tree, and let us be united and unanimous; such
Prohibition of our Assemblies will be of ill Consequence, and
occasion Differences between us.</p>

<p>"We acknowledge, I say, our sending Agents to <i>Canada</i> for
Peace, we were incouraged in doing this, by the Knowledge we
have of the Governor of <i>Canada</i>. He is an old Man, and was
formerly Governor of that Place. He was always esteemed a wise
peaceable Man, and therefore we trust our Message will have a
good Issue. We did not take it amiss that you sent to the
<i>Dewagunhas</i>, nor that <i>Arnout</i> was sent to the <i>Satanas</i>, both
of them our Enemies; and, for the same Reason, our Brother
<i>Cayenguirago</i> ought not to be displeased with our sending to
the <i>French</i> for Peace.</p>

<p>"We, <i>Onondagas</i>, acknowledge ourselves to have been the chief
Promoters of this Message, we have sent in all nine <i>Sachems</i>
with nine Belts. It is true we are now under much Uneasiness in
having trusted so many <i>Sachems</i> in the <i>French</i> Hands, being
almost half the Number we have in our Nation, but we were in
haste to prevent the Designs the <i>French</i> had against our
Countries and yours, by the great warlike Preparations they were
making in <i>Canada</i>."</p></div>

<p>Then he told all the Orders and Directions which their Ambassadors had
received; which agreeing with the Account which <i>Decanesora</i> gave of his
Negotiation, I shall here pass over. He finished all by <b>giving a Belt</b>.</p>

<p>Colonel <i>Fletcher</i> told them, he would give no Answer to what they had
said, before they discovered to him what Reason they had to say, that he
had forbid their holding any Assembly at <i>Onondaga</i>, and that he had
made Peace with the <i>Dewagunhas</i> and <i>Satanas</i>, without their Consent
and Concurrence.</p>

<p>To this the Speaker the next Day answered; "I was sick, and absent when
the Affairs you mention were transacted, and I was at a Loss how to
excuse our sending to the <i>French</i> contrary to your Advice; but several
<i>Sachems</i> being arrived since I spoke, I have been better informed by
them, who were present at those Transactions. We find it, in every
Circumstance, as our Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i> says; that you did not
obstruct our keeping General Councils at <i>Onondaga</i>, but only cautioned
us in hearkening to the Fallacies of the <i>French</i>, and in holding
Meetings on that Occasion. We assure you we will never separate from
you, we still have one Head, one Blood, one Soul, and one Heart with
you; and as a Confirmation of this I <b>give this Belt seven deep</b>.</p>

<p>"As to the <i>Dewagunhas</i> and <i>Shawonons</i>, we are confident <i>Cayenguirago</i>
will not admit them into his Government, till they have made Peace with
us, which we shall willingly grant. When our Enemies are humbled, and
beg Peace, why should they not have it? Let them come and live with us,
it will strengthen our Country.</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, when the Christians first arrived in this
Country, we received them kindly. When they were but a small People, we
entered into a League with them, to guard them from all Enemies
whatsoever. We were so fond of their Society, that we tied the great
Canoe which brought them, not with a Rope made of Bark to a Tree, but
with a strong iron Chain fastened to a great Mountain. Now before the
Christians arrived, the General Council of the <i>Five Nations</i> was held
at <i>Onondaga</i>, where there has, from the Beginning, a continual Fire
been kept burning; it is made of two great Logs, whose Fire never
extinguishes. As soon as the Hatchet-makers (their general Name for
Christians) arrived, this General Council at <i>Onondaga</i> planted this
Tree at <i>Albany</i>, whose Roots and Branches have since spread as far as
<i>New-England</i>, <i>Connecticut, Pensilvania, Maryland</i> and <i>Virginia</i>; and
under the Shade of this Tree all these <i>English</i> Colonies have
frequently been sheltered. Then (<b>giving seven Fathom of Wampum</b>) he
renewed the Chain, and promised, as they likewise expected, mutual
Assistance, in Case of any Attack from any Enemy.</p>

<p>"The only Reason, to be plain with you, continued he, of our sending to
make Peace with the <i>French</i>, is the low Condition to which we are
reduced, while none of our Neighbours send us the least Assistance, so
that the whole Burthen of the War lyes on us alone. Our Brethren of
<i>New-England, Connecticut</i>, <i>Pensilvania, Maryland</i> and <i>Virginia</i>, of
their own accord thrust their Arms into our Chain; but since the War
began we have received no Assistance from them. We alone cannot continue
the War against the <i>French</i>, by Reason of the Recruits they daily
receive from the other Side the great Lake.</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, speak from your Heart, are you resolved to
prosecute the War vigorously against the <i>French</i>, and are your
Neighbours of <i>Virginia, Maryland, Pensilvania, Connecticut</i> and
<i>New-England</i>, resolved to assist us? If it be so, we assure you,
notwithstanding any Treaty hitherto entered into, we will prosecute the
War as hotly as ever. But if our Neighbours will not assist, we must
make Peace, and we submit it to your Consideration, by <b>giving this great
Belt fifteen deep</b>.</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, I have truly told you the Reasons which have
induced us to offer Peace to the <i>French</i>; we shall likewise, from the
Bottom of our Hearts, inform you of the Design we have in this Treaty.
When the Governor of <i>Canada</i> shall have accepted the nine Belts, of
which I have just now told you, then we shall have something more to say
by two large Belts, which lye still hid in our Bosom. We shall lay down
first one and say, We have a Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, with whose People
we have been united in one Chain from the Beginning, they must be
included in this Treaty; we cannot see them involved in bloody War,
while we sit in easy Peace. If the Governor of <i>Canada</i> answer, that he
has made a separate Peace with us, and that he cannot make any Peace
with <i>Cayenguirago</i>, because the War is from over the great Lake; then
we shall lay down the second great broad Belt, and tell the Governor of
<i>Canada</i>, if you will not include <i>Cayenguirago</i>'s People, the Treaty
will become thereby void, as if it had never been made; and if he
persists, we will absolutely leave him."</p>

<p>While the <i>Sachems</i> were at <i>Albany</i>, <i>Decanesora</i> and the other
Ambassadors arrived at the Castle of the <i>Praying Indians</i>, near the
Falls above <i>Montreal</i>. They were conducted from thence, by the Superior
of the Jesuits, to <i>Quebeck</i>. They had their Audience of the Governor of
<i>Canada</i> with great Solemnity, in the Presence of all the Ecclesiasticks
and Officers of Distinction, and of the most considerable <i>Indians</i> then
in the Place. They were every Day, while they staid in the Place,
entertained at the Governor's Table, or at the Tables of the most
considerable Officers. <i>Decanesora</i> on his Side made a good Appearance,
being cloathed in Scarlet trim'd with Gold, and with a laced Bever Hat
on his Head, which had been given him by Colonel <i>Fletcher</i> before he
went.</p>

<p>The Jesuit <i>Milet</i> had by Letter informed the Governor of every Thing in
their Commission, and though he was thereby enabled to have answered
them immediately, he consulted three Days, after the Ambassadors had
delivered what they had to say, before he would return an Answer, that
it might appear with more Solemnity. The <i>Indians</i> never return a sudden
Answer on any Occasion of Importance, however resolved they be
beforehand, and despise those that do, though their Answer be never so
much to the Purpose. I choose to give an Account of this from
<i>Decanesora</i>'s Mouth, as I did of the former, and for the same Reason.
The Account given of it by the <i>Indians</i> agrees, in all the material
Points, with that published by the <i>French</i>, and I am confident it is
not less genuine.</p>

<p>Colonel <i>Fletcher</i> being sensible of what Consequence this Treaty
between the <i>French</i> and <i>Five Nations</i> might be of to all the <i>English</i>
Colonies, gave them Notice of it, and informed them of the Reasons which
had induced the <i>Indians</i> to enter into it. He told them, there was no
Possibility of preventing it, but by the <i>Indians</i> being assured of more
effectual Assistance, than they had hitherto received, and advised them
to send Commissioners for that Purpose to <i>Albany</i> in <i>August</i>, at which
Time he intended to meet the <i>Five Nations</i> there, after the Return of
their Messengers from <i>Canada</i>. Accordingly, <i>Andrew Hamilton</i>, Esq;
Governor of <i>New-Jersey</i>, Colonel <i>John Pinchon</i>, <i>Samuel Sands</i>, Esq;
and Major <i>Pen Townsend</i>, Commissioners from <i>Massachuset's Bay</i>, and
Colonel <i>John Hauley</i> and Captain <i>Stanley</i>, Commissioners from
<i>Connecticut</i>, waited on Colonel <i>Fletcher</i> at <i>Albany</i>, who carried
with him likewise a Part of the Council of <i>New-York</i>.</p>

<p>These Gentlemen having met the <i>Indians</i> at <i>Albany</i> the fifteenth of
<i>August</i>, <i>Decanesora</i> rose up first, and desired Leave to sing a Song
or two of Peace, before they began on Business. Then <i>Rode</i>, a <i>Mohawk
Sachem</i>, rose up, and addressing himself to the other <i>Sachems</i>, said,
we have great Reason to rejoice, seeing so many of those, who are in our
Chain, are now met, to consult together on the general Weal; after which
they sang two or three Songs.</p>

<p><i>Sadakanahtie</i> being chosen Speaker for that Day, rose up, spoke much to
the same Purpose as he had done to Colonel <i>Fletcher</i> in <i>May</i> last;
giving a metaphorical Account of their League with the <i>English</i>, how it
began, and by what Steps it had been inlarged and strengthened; how the
other Colonies had thrust their Arms into this Chain, but had given
little or no Assistance against the common Enemy. "Our Brother
<i>Cayenguirago</i>'s Arms (says he) and ours are stiff, and tired with
holding fast the Chain, whilst our Neighbours sit still and smoak at
their Ease. The Fat is melted from our Flesh, and fallen on our
Neighbours, who grow fat while we grow lean: They flourish while we
decay.</p>

<p>"This Chain made us the Envy of the <i>French</i>, and if all had held it as
fast as <i>Cayenguirago</i>, it would have been a Terror also. If we would
all heartily join and take the Hatchet in our Hand, our common Enemy
would soon be destroyed, and we should for ever after live in Peace and
Ease. Do you but your Parts, and Thunder itself cannot break our Chain."</p>

<p>Then he mentioned some Jealousies they had entertained of <i>New-England</i>,
by their suffering the Chevalier <i>D'O</i> to escape to <i>Canada</i>, which they
suspected had been concerted between him and the People of
<i>New-England</i>, in Order to treat of Peace. "Our Agents, said he, saw the
Chevalier <i>D'O</i> at <i>Canada</i>, who told them that he had been set at
Liberty by the <i>English</i>, and that it was in vain that the <i>Five
Nations</i> warred against the <i>French</i>, while the <i>English</i> favoured
them." On this Occasion he shewed them a Fish painted on Paper, which
the Commissioners of <i>New-England</i> had given them, when they first
entered into the Chain, as a Seal to the League.</p>

<p>He finished by telling them, that they would next Day give all the
Particulars of their Negotiation in <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>The next Day <i>Decanesora</i> proceeded to the Account of his Negotiation,
as follows: "The Governor of <i>Canada</i> having often sent to us to come to
<i>Canada</i> to treat with him, we went thither, and told him that we were
come to treat of Peace. We made the following Proposals.</p>

<p>"Father, if we do not conclude a Peace now, it will be your Fault; for
we have already taken the Hatchet out of the Hands of the <i>River
Indians</i> (<i>Hudson</i>'s River) whom we incited to the War. But we must tell
you, that you are an ill Man, you are inconstant and not to be trusted;
we have had War together a long Time, and though you occasioned the War,
we never hated the House of <i>Oghessa</i>, (a Gentleman living at
<i>Montreal</i>) let him undertake the toilsome Journey to <i>Onondaga</i>; for if
he will he shall be welcome.</p>

<p>"Father, we are now speaking of Peace, and therefore I must speak a Word
to the <i>Praying Indians</i>, and first to those of <i>Cahnuaga</i> (chiefly
<i>Mohawks</i>) you know our Customs and Manners, therefore make <i>Onondio</i>
acquainted therewith, and be assisting in the prosecuting of this good
Work. Then to the other Castle, called <i>Canassadaga</i>, (chiefly
<i>Onondagas</i>) you are worse than the <i>French</i> themselves, you deserted
from us, and side with our Enemies to destroy us; make some amends now,
by forwarding Peace.</p>

<p>"You have almost eat us up, our best Men are killed in this bloody War;
but we now forget what is past. Before this we once threw the Hatchet
into the River of <i>Kaihohage</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, but you fished it up, and
treacherously surprised our People at <i>Cadarackui</i>. After this you sent
to us to have our Prisoners restored; then the Hatchet was thrown up to
the Sky, but you kept a String fastened to the Helve, and pulled it
down, and fell upon our People again. This we revenged to some Purpose,
by the Destruction of your People and Houses in the Island of
<i>Montreal</i>.</p>

<p>"Now we are come to cover the Blood from our Sight, which has been shed
by both Sides during this long War.</p>

<p>"<i>Onondio</i>, we have been at War a long Time, we now give you a Medicine
to drive away all ill Thoughts from your Heart, to purge it and make it
clean, and restore it to its former State.</p>

<p>"<i>Onondio</i>, we will not permit any Settlement at <i>Cadarackui</i>; you have
had your Fire there thrice extinguished; we will not consent to your
rebuilding that Fort, but the Passage through the River shall be free
and clear. We make the Sun clean, and drive away all Clouds and
Darkness, that we may see the Light without Interruption.</p>

<p>"<i>Onondio</i>, we have taken many Prisoners from one another, during the
War. The Prisoners we took have been delivered, according to our Custom,
to the Families that have lost any in the War. They no longer belong to
the Publick, they may give them back if they please, your People may do
the same. We have brought back two Prisoners, and restore them to you.</p>

<p>"After I had finished what I had to say, continued he, the Governor of
<i>Canada</i> told me, that he would not make Peace with <i>Cayenguirago</i>. To
this I answered, these Words displease me much, you shall keep Peace
with him. <i>Onondio</i> said again, I must fight with <i>Cayenguirago</i>, it is
not in my Power to make Peace; this can only be done by my Master, who
lives over the great Water. To this I replied, I cannot bear this
Discourse; if you should fight him now, and not stay till I get Home,
all the Country will look on me as a Traytor; I can treat with you no
longer. The Argument on this Subject lasted three Days, at last the
Governor of <i>Canada</i> assured me, that he would not undertake any
Enterprize against <i>Cayenguirago</i> this Summer, but would wait to hear
what he wou'd say.</p>

<p>"The Governor of <i>Canada</i> insisted three Days to have Hostages left,
which I refused, but two agreeing of their own accord to stay, they were
left, <i>viz</i>. one an <i>Onondago</i>, another a <i>Seneka</i>.</p>

<p>"Then the Governor of <i>Canada</i> made the following publick Answer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I. I accept of Peace as you offer.</p>

<p>"II. Son, bring all the Prisoners back that you have taken from me, and
yours shall have Liberty to return Home, if they please.</p>

<p>"III. Children, erect my Fire again at <i>Cadarackui</i>, and plant there the
Tree of Peace.</p>
</div>

<p>"After this the Governor of <i>Canada</i> delivered me a Belt, which I now
lay down before you; by it he said, desire <i>Cayenguirago</i> to send a wise
Man to me, and he shall have Protection according to the Custom of
Christians; and added,</p>

<p>"Children of the <i>Five Nations</i>, if <i>Cayenguirago</i> shall employ you to
do any Service for him, do not accept of it, let him send his own
People."</p>

<p><i>Decanesora</i> added, that the Governor of <i>Canada</i> had fixed eighty Days
for a Return to this Belt.</p>

<p>He continued and said, "The <i>Sachems</i> of the <i>Dionondadies</i> were
present; after I had finished my Speech, they said; May what you have
now said be from your Hearts; we suspect you are not sincere; let us no
longer feel the Smart of the Hatchet, and gave this Belt which I now lay
down.</p>

<p>"The <i>Praying Indians</i> next said, Brethren, our Father <i>Onondio</i> has
told you to bring Home all the Prisoners, do not fail in this; <b>giving
two Belts</b>.</p>

<p>"Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, you will find what I have now said confirmed by
this Paper, which the Governor of <i>Canada</i> gave me. I brought Letters
likewise for the Jesuit <i>Milet</i>, who was to read the Paper to us." The
Paper contained the Articles in <i>French</i>, in which the Governor of
<i>Canada</i> was willing to make Peace.</p>

<p>But besides what <i>Decanesora</i> here tells, the <i>French</i> Accounts say,
that he brought two Belts underground (that is privately) from three
<i>Onondaga Sachems</i>, to assure the Governor of <i>Canada</i> of their
particular Affection, which the Governor of <i>Canada</i> answered, by a
private Belt to them.</p>

<p>As soon as <i>Decanesora</i> had done speaking, Colonel <i>Fletcher</i> rejected
the Belt sent by the Governor of <i>Canada</i>, saying; If the Governor of
<i>Canada</i> have any Thing to say to me, let him send some of his People to
<i>Albany</i>, and they shall have Protection.</p>

<p>Next Day <i>Sadekanahtie</i>, after he had sung a long Song, gave the
following Account of their Negotiations with the <i>Dewagunhas</i> and
<i>Dionondadies</i>, which they had undertaken by the Governor's Advice.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We were afraid, says he, to send Messengers of our own People,
and therefore we employed two Prisoners we had of the
<i>Dionondadies</i> with the Governor's Belt. Some time after this,
some of the <i>Senekas</i> hunting near the <i>Dionondadies</i>, two of
them were taken; but when they were carried to the <i>Dionondadie</i>
Castle, they were not treated like Prisoners; they were used
kindly, and sent back with the following Offers of Peace.</p>

<p>"We are glad to see you Face to Face to speak to you, since the
Sun has been so propitious to send home the Men that were
Prisoners with you, giving a few Strings of Wampum.</p>

<p>"We are glad of this Opportunity to tell you, that we have been
both drunk in making War on one another; we now give you a
Cordial to ease your Hearts, that there be no longer War between
us, by <b>this Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"We are glad that you have set the Doors open as far as
<i>Cayenguirago</i>'s House, that we may freely go thither. Carry him
<b>this second Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"Brethren, we thank you for having prepared a Place for us at
your General Council of <i>Onondaga</i>. Our Country is every where
free to you to treat with us, by <b>this third Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"Brethren, our whole Country rejoiced when you invited us into
your Country, and from thence to go where <i>Cayenguirago</i> dwells;
be not afraid to come to our Country, you shall meet with no
Molestation.</p>

<p>"Brethren, we thank you for putting us in Mind of what was
formerly agreed to, <i>viz</i>. that when any ill Accident happens,
we were to meet together to compose Matters, and not to revenge
it with War. We are now together to put an End to all
Misunderstanding, by <b>this fourth Belt</b>.</p>

<p>"Brethren, (we include all the Nations from the <i>Senekas</i>
Country to <i>New-York</i> in this Name) hearken to us. We rend the
Clouds asunder, and drive away all Darkness from the Heavens,
that the Sun of Peace may shine with Brightness over us all;
<b>giving a Sun</b> of a round red polished Stone.</p>

<p>"Brethren, we put the Hatchet into the Hands of the
<i>Chightaghies</i>, <i>Twithtwies</i>, and <i>Odsirachies</i>, to war against
you; but we shall in three Days go to these Nations and take the
Hatchet out of their Hands; <b>giving half a Stone Pipe</b>.</p>

<p>"You <i>Senekas</i> are stupid Creatures, we must therefore warn you
not to hunt so far from your Castles, lest you be hurt by any of
these three Nations, and then blame us. They then <b>gave the other
half of the Pipe</b>.</p>

<p>"But Brother <i>Cayenguirago</i>, says <i>Sadakahnitie</i>, do not suffer
these Nations to come nearer than the <i>Senekas</i> Country, lest
they discover our Weakness, and to what a low Condition the War
has reduced us. These Nations have been so long in Friendship
with the <i>French</i>, and are so much under their Influence, that
we cannot trust them yet, or be too much upon our Guard against
them."</p></div>

<p>Colonel <i>Fletcher</i> not being able to give the <i>Five Nations</i> any
Assurance of a vigorous Assistance, he called the principal <i>Sachems</i> to
a private Conference on the twentieth. He asked them, whether they had
made Peace with the Governor of <i>Canada</i>; they answered, that it only
wanted his Approbation, and added, that they could no longer carry on
the War without Assistance. You have the whole Negotiations before you,
say they, and we submit it to your Prudence.</p>

<p>He then allowed them to make Peace, provided they kept faithful in their
Chain with the <i>English</i>; but told them, that as to his Part he could
make no Peace with the Governor of <i>Canada</i>. They were under great
Uneasiness to leave their Friends in the War, they said, and wished,
since neither the Governor of <i>Canada</i> nor he would receive Proposals by
their Hands, that they might think of some neutral Place to treat. The
Governor answered, that he could neither receive nor send any Message on
that Head; and that Peace could be only made between them by the two
Kings.</p>

<p>The Governor next asked them, whether they would permit the <i>French</i> to
build again at <i>Cadarackui</i>; they answered, they would never permit it,
and were resolved to insist on it, in all the ensuing Treaties, that he
never shall. Then the Governor added, if you permit the French to build
any where on that Lake, there will be an End to your Liberty, your
Posterity will become Slaves to the <i>French</i>. If ever you should permit
them, I will look on it as an absolute Breach of the Chain with us: If
the <i>French</i> attempt it give me Notice, and I will march the whole Force
of my Government to your Assistance. We shall find afterwards, however,
that the Government of <i>New-York</i> was far from making good this Promise.</p>

<p>The Governor told them, that they had lost much of their Honour in
creeping to the <i>French</i>, in such an abject Manner; for, says he, the
Governor of <i>Canada</i>'s Paper, which you brought with you, says, that you
came in the most humble and penitent Manner, and begged Peace. To which
they answered, the Governor of <i>Canada</i> has no Reason to make such
Reflexions, we have many of his Belts to shew, by which he again and
again sued to us for Peace, before we would hearken to him. But, replies
the Governor, how came you to call him Father? For no other Reason, they
replied, but because he calls us Children. These Names signify nothing.</p>

<p>They desired the Governor not to say any Thing particularly of
<i>Cadarackui</i>, in his publick Speech that he was to make next Day, for
they had, they said, some among them that would tell all to the Governor
of <i>Canada</i>; and concluded, with wishing that they had some one, who
could write and read all that the Governor had said to them, that they
might not forget any Part of it, when they come to consult and resolve
on this weighty Affair, at their General Council at <i>Onondaga</i>.</p>

<p>Here we see these Barbarians, these Savages, as we call them, acting
with the greatest regard to the Treaties they had entered into with
their Allies, and that at a Time when the Exigences of their own
Affairs, and when the faint feeble Assistance, which their Allies had
contributed in the common Cause, would, among Christian Potentates, have
been thought a sufficient Excuse for their taking Care of themselves
separately, in breach of the most solemn Confederacy they could enter
into.</p>

<p>The <i>Sachems</i> of the <i>Five Nations</i> being met at <i>Onondaga</i>, to consult
on the Terms offered by the <i>French</i>, they were divided in their
Opinions; the <i>Cayugas</i>, and Part of the <i>Senekas</i>, were most favourable
to the <i>French</i> Proposals; but the major Part was absolutely against
allowing the <i>French</i> to rebuild a Fort at <i>Cadarackui</i>, nor would they
consent to include all the <i>French</i> Allies in the Treaty, with some of
which they had particular Causes of Animosity.</p>

<p>The Party that was most for Peace obtained Leave to go to <i>Canada</i>, to
try whether they could obtain Terms less disagreeable. They accordingly
went thither, within the Time prefixed by the Governor of <i>Canada</i>, for
an Answer; and to make themselves more acceptable to the <i>French</i>, they
carried thirteen Prisoners with them, and delivered them up. The Jesuit
<i>Milet</i> was of this Number, who had been taken in the Year 1689, and one
<i>Jonscaire</i>, who had been long a Prisoner among the <i>Senekas</i>: He had
been delivered up to a Family of the <i>Senekas</i>, that had lost some
considerable Relation, and was by them adopted. He ingratiated himself
so much with that Nation, that he was advanced to the Rank of a
<i>Sachem</i>, and preserved their Esteem to the Day of his Death; whereby
he became, after the general Peace, very useful to the <i>French</i> in all
Negotiations with the <i>Five Nations</i>, and to this Day they shew their
Regard to his Family and Children.</p>

<p>When the Governor of <i>Canada</i> came to Particulars with these Deputies,
he could obtain nothing but ambiguous or dubious Answers, as to the
rebuilding of <i>Cadarackui Fort</i>, and the including of all the <i>French</i>
Allies in the Peace. Whereupon he dismissed them with Presents, and made
them many fair Promises, in Case of their Compliance; but threatened
them with utter Destruction, in Case of their refusing the Terms he had
offered. Many of the <i>French Indian</i> Allies were present, when the
Governor of <i>Canada</i> refused any Agreement without his Allies being
included in it, and this attached them exceedingly to the <i>French</i>
Interest. This Regard, which the <i>French</i> generally shew for the
Interest of their Allies, is a Piece of Policy which, upon all
Occasions, proves useful to them; whereas, the Neglect of this Piece of
natural Justice has as often been prejudicial to others, who have not
had so tender a Sense of it. But it is not so easy for a weak State to
keep up its Honour in such Cases, as it is for a powerful Prince.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_2_XI" id="CHAP_2_XI"></a>CHAP. XI.</h2>

<h4><i>The War renewed</i>. <i>The</i> French <i>repossess themselves of</i> Cadarackui
<i>Fort</i>, <i>and find Means to break off the Treaty between the</i> Five
Nations <i>and</i> Dionondadies.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he <i>Five Nations</i> refusing to come to the Governor of <i>Canada</i>'s Terms,
he resolved to force them; and as he suspected that they continued
obstinate, by the Advice of the <i>English</i>, and the Confidence they had
of the <i>English</i> Assistance, he thought he would most effectually lessen
that Confidence, by attacking and destroying the remainder of the
<i>Mohawks</i>, who liv'd adjoining to the <i>English</i> Settlements. For this
Purpose he resolved to march, in the Winter, the whole Force of <i>Canada</i>
against that Nation; but one of the Prisoners learning their Design,
made his Escape, and informed the <i>Mohawks</i> of it. This made him alter
his Measures, knowing well enough, that if the <i>English</i> were prepared
to receive them, such an Enterprize would only lead those engaged in it
to certain Destruction. He then sent three hundred Men into the Neck of
Land between <i>Lake Erie</i> and <i>Cadarackui Lake</i>, the usual hunting Place
of the <i>Five Nations</i>, in hopes of surprising them while they hunted
carelessly there, and at the same Time to view the old <i>French</i> Fort
there, to observe in what Condition it remained.</p>

<p>This Party met with three or four Men, who defended themselves
obstinately, till they all fell dead on the Spot. They surprised
likewise a Cabin, where they took some Men and Women Prisoners; and four
of them were publickly burnt alive at <i>Montreal</i>. So far the Count <i>de
Frontenac</i> thought it more proper to imitate the <i>Indians</i> in their most
savage Cruelties, than to instruct them, by his Example, in the
Compassion of the Christian Doctrine. A Party of one hundred and fifty
of the <i>Five Nations</i> fell upon the <i>Dewagunhas</i>, in their Way to
<i>Canada</i>, and entirely routed them. Ten Prisoners were taken, nine of
which were burnt alive, in revenge of the same Fate the four Men of the
<i>Five Nations</i> had received at <i>Montreal</i>.</p>

<p>This Year also some sculking <i>French Indians</i> murdered some People near
<i>Albany</i> and <i>Schenectady</i>.</p>

<p>The Party sent to view <i>Cadarackui Fort</i> found it in a better Condition
than they expected, the <i>Indians</i> having neglected to demolish and level
the Bastions, and probably they had not Instruments sufficient to do it.
The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> therefore, in the Summer of the Year 1695, sent
a considerable Body of Men, both <i>French</i> and <i>Indians</i>, thither, to
repair the Fortifications, and to cover those that should be at work.
The <i>Five Nations</i>, in <i>August</i>, sent Messengers to <i>Albany</i>, to
acquaint the <i>English</i> that the <i>French</i> had taken Possession of
<i>Cadarackui</i>, and were repairing of it. They demanded, in Consequence of
the Promise Colonel <i>Fletcher</i> had given them, the Assistance of five
hundred Men and some Cannon, which they promised they would draw over
Land, where they could not be carried by Water. At the same Time they
desired, that the People of <i>New-England</i> might be told, that many of
the <i>Owenagungas</i> were gone with the <i>French</i> to <i>Cadarackui</i>, and that
this was a proper Time to fall upon those that remained, and to destroy
them, and the Women and Children.</p>

<p>Coll. <i>Fletcher</i> came to <i>Albany</i> in <i>September</i>; there, in a Speech to
the <i>Five Nations</i>, he blamed them for being asleep, when they suffered
the <i>French</i> to take Possession of <i>Cadarackui</i>; it would have been much
easier, he said, to have prevented their getting the Possession, than to
drive them out, now they are in it, especially as now you yourselves are
convinced, that it is impossible to carry Cannon thither from this
Place. All, says he, I can now do, is to advise you to invest the Place
with your Parties, so as to prevent their receiving any Supply of
Provisions: By this Means you may force them to desert it. Then he gave
them 1000 Pound of Powder, two Thousand Pound of Lead, 57 Fusees, one
Hundred Hatchets, three Hundred and forty eight Knives, and two
Thousand Flints, besides Cloathing, &amp;c. But in my Opinion, the
Government of <i>New-York</i> have, on all Occasions, been exceedingly to be
blamed, in not having some Men of Experience among the <i>Five Nations</i> to
advise and direct them on all Emergencies of Importance. The <i>French</i>
are very careful of this, and the <i>Officers</i> of the regular Troops are
obliged to take their Tours among their <i>Indians</i>, while the Captains of
the independent Companies of Fusiliers at <i>New-York</i> live like military
Monks, in Idleness and Luxury.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> gained a great Advantage, by possessing this Place, as it
is of great Security to their Traders, in their passing between
<i>Montreal</i> and <i>Missilimakinak</i>. It served likewise as a Place of
Stores, and Retreat in all their Enterprizes against the <i>Five Nations</i>,
that Place being nearly about half Way between <i>Montreal</i> and the
Country of the <i>Five Nations</i>. It likewise exposed the <i>Five Nations</i> in
their hunting, to the Incursions of that Garison, by its being in the
Neighbourhood of their principal hunting Place for Bever.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> grew exceedingly uneasy, when they found, that the
<i>Dionondadies</i>, who live near <i>Missilimakinak</i>, had almost concluded a
Peace with the <i>Five Nations</i>, and that the rest of their Allies were
like to follow their Example: Some of these Nations had been at
<i>Montreal</i>, and at their Return forwarded the Peace, that thereby they
might be at Liberty to go to <i>Albany</i>; for they informed their
Neighbours, that the <i>Five Nations</i> had intirely shut up the Path to
<i>Montreal</i>; and besides that, the <i>French</i> were not in a Condition to
supply them, for they had nothing for themselves, not so much as a Drop
of strong Spirits. If these Nations had, at that Time, deserted the
<i>French</i>, it might probably have put an End to the <i>French</i> Colony; for
as the Lands of <i>Canada</i> barely produce sufficient for the Subsistence
of its Inhabitants, the only Means they have of purchasing Cloathing and
other Necessaries is by their Trade with the <i>Indians</i>. The <i>French</i>
likewise had been in Danger of greater Mischief by the Peace, for these
Nations being at War with the <i>Five Nations</i>, and lying on the Back of
them, obliged the <i>Five Nations</i> to keep always a very considerable Part
of their Force at home, to defend themselves against these Nations, and
to revenge the Injuries they received from them; but if the Peace had
been concluded with these Nations, the <i>Five Nations</i> could have turned
their whole Force against <i>Canada</i>, and probably might have persuaded
these Nations to have joined with them in warring on the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> Commandant at <i>Missilimakinak</i> had his Hands full at this
Time; and if he had not been a Man of great Abilities, he must have sunk
under the Difficulties he had to go through; in the first Place, to
contradict the Stories brought from <i>Montreal</i>, he ordered the Stores of
his Fort to be sold to the <i>Indians</i> at the cheapest Rate, and assured
them, that great Quantities were every Day expected from <i>France</i>, which
were only detained by contrary Winds; and after these Goods shall
arrive, said he, they will be sold cheaper than ever they have been. He
told them likewise, that the Count <i>de Frontenac</i> would never make Peace
with the <i>Five Nations</i>, but was resolved to extirpate them; for which
Purpose he was now rebuilding <i>Cadarackui Fort</i>. At the same Time he
took all possible Methods to extinguish the Beginnings of Friendship,
which appeared between the <i>Five Nations</i> and <i>Dionondadies</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Dionondadies</i> durst not avow their treating with the <i>Five Nations</i>
to the <i>French</i>, neither durst the <i>Five Nations</i> trust their Agents in
a Place where they knew the <i>French</i> had so great Influence; both Sides
therefore agreed to carry on their Treaty by Means of Prisoners which
they took from one another. The Civility with which the <i>Dionondadies</i>
treated these Prisoners, their dismissing them, and their receiving
again Prisoners which had been taken by the <i>Five Nations</i>, gave the
Commandant sufficient Ground to suspect what was doing. The
<i>Dionondadies</i> at last took seven Men of the <i>Five Nations</i> Prisoners,
and carried them to <i>Missilimakinak</i>. The <i>French</i> perceiving, by their
Manner of bringing them in, that the <i>Dionondadies</i> intended to treat
them with the Civility they had lately used to others, murdered two of
them with their Knives as they stept ashore. On this the <i>Dionondadies</i>
immediately took to their Arms, saved the other Five, and carried them
safe to their Castle; and continuing in Arms, threatened Revenge for the
Insult they had received.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> were forced in like Manner to stand to their Arms, and as
there are always many different Nations at <i>Missilimakinak</i> trading,
some of which were inveterate Enemies of the <i>Five Nations</i>, they joined
with the <i>French</i>. The <i>Utawawas</i> stood neuter. This gave the Commandant
Means of ending the Dispute by Composition. He in the first Place
assured them, that the Christians abhorred all Manner of Cruelty, and
then told them, that as the <i>French</i> shared with the <i>Dionondadies</i> in
all the Dangers and Losses sustained by the War, they ought in like
Manner to partake with them in any Advantage. The <i>Dionondadies</i> on this
were persuaded to deliver up one of the Prisoners. What I am about to
relate, I think, gives Room to charge the <i>French</i> with a Piece of
Policy, not only inconsistent with the Christian Religion, but likewise
with the Character of a polite People; and that all Considerations from
Religion, Honour, and Virtue, must give Way to the present Exigencies of
their Affairs. That an End might be put to the Beginnings of a
Reconciliation between these People and the <i>Five Nations</i>, the <i>French</i>
gave a publick Invitation to feast on the Soup to be made on this
Prisoner, and, in a more particular Manner, invited the <i>Utawawas</i> to
the Entertainment.</p>

<p>The Prisoner being first made fast to a Stake, so as to have Room to
move round it, a <i>Frenchman</i> began the horrid Tragedy, by broiling the
Flesh of the Prisoner's Legs, from his Toes to his Knees, with the red
hot Barrel of a Gun; his Example was followed by an <i>Utawawa</i>, and they
relieved one another as they grew tired. The Prisoner all this while
continued his Death Song, till they clapt a red hot Frying-pan on his
Buttocks, when he cried out, Fire is strong and too powerful; then all
their <i>Indians</i> mocked him, as wanting Courage and Resolution. You, they
said, a Soldier and a Captain, as you say, and afraid of Fire; you are
not a Man. They continued their Torments for two Hours without ceasing.
An <i>Utawawa</i> being desirous to outdo the <i>French</i> in their refined
Cruelty, split a Furrow from the Prisoner's Shoulder to his Garter, and
filling it with Gunpowder, set Fire to it. This gave him exquisite Pain,
and raised excessive Laughter in his Tormenters. When they found his
Throat so much parched, that he was no longer able to gratify their Ears
with his howling, they gave him Water, to enable him to continue their
Pleasure longer. But at last his Strength failing, an <i>Utawawa</i> flead
off his Scalp, and threw burning hot Coals on his Scull. Then they
untied him, and bid him run for his Life: He began to run, tumbling like
a drunken Man; they shut up the Way to the East, and made him run
Westward, the Country, as they think, of departed (miserable) Souls. He
had still Force left to throw Stones, till they put an End to his Misery
by knocking him on the Head with a Stone. After this every one cut a
Slice from his Body, to conclude the Tragedy with a Feast. It is doing
no Injury, I think, to these <i>Frenchmen</i>, who thus glory in this horrid
Cruelty, to ask them, whether they did not likewise regale their
revengeful Appetites with a Share of this inhuman Feast?</p>

<p>Though I have had frequent Occasions to mention these barbarous inhuman
Cruelties, transacted by the <i>Indians</i>, yet I have avoided to relate the
particular Circumstances of them, because I believe few civilized Ears
can bear the reading of them without Horror. But when they are
perpetrated by Christians, and so far gloried in, as to be recorded in
their own History, I am willing to shew it to my Countrymen in its
proper Colours. This last Piece of <i>French</i> History is taken from
<i>Histoire de l'Amerique Septentrionale, par Monsr. de la Poterie</i>,
published at <i>Paris</i> with the Royal Licence, and recommended to the
Publick by Mons. <i>Fontenelle</i>, Vol. ii. Page 298.</p>

<p>Though this cruel Act had its designed Effect, in breaking off this
Method of negotiating between the <i>Five Nations</i> and <i>Dionondadies</i>, it
did not prevent the Peace; and it had very near raised a Civil War with
their own <i>Indians</i>, which was only prevented by the dextrous Conduct of
the <i>French</i> Officers, who, in all kind of Artifice, have always been
superior to the <i>Indians</i>. But let me observe on this Occasion, that
the avoiding any Misfortune, by any base or wicked Action, is commonly
the Cause of greater Mischiefs than what is thereby avoided; and of this
numerous Examples may be given.</p>

<h4><i>The Count</i> de Frontenac <i>attacks</i> Onondaga <i>in Person</i>, <i>with the whole
Force of</i> Canada. <i>The</i> Five Nations <i>continue the War with the</i> French,
<i>and make Peace with the</i> Dionondadies.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Count <i>de Frontenac</i> having secured <i>Cadarackui Fort</i>, which was
called by his Name, as a Place of Arms and Provisions, and for a Retreat
to the Men that should happen to be sick or wounded, resolved to make
the <i>Five Nations</i> feel his Resentment of their refusing his Terms of
Peace. For this Purpose he assembled all the regular Troops of <i>Canada</i>,
the Militia, the <i>Owenagungas</i>, the <i>Quatoghies</i> of <i>Loretto</i>, the
<i>Adirondacks</i>, <i>Sokokies</i>, <i>Nepiciriniens</i>, the <i>Praying Indians</i> of the
<i>Five Nations</i>, and a few <i>Utawawas</i>, at <i>Montreal</i>, in <i>June</i> 1696. The
other western <i>Indians</i> near <i>Missilimakinak</i>, by their late
Correspondence with the <i>Five Nations</i>, and the Dissatisfaction they had
manifested, were not trusted. The Manner of making War with the
<i>Indians</i> in a Country wholly covered with Woods, must be so much
different from the Methods used in <i>Europe</i>, that I believe the Reader
will be pleased to have a particular Account of the Count <i>de
Frontenac</i>'s Conduct in this, who was an old experienced General, in the
seventy fourth Year of his Age.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that it is impossible to pass the vast Forests
between the Countries of the <i>Five Nations</i> with Waggons, or other
Carriages, or on Horseback, or even on Foot, in the summer Time, by
Reason of many impassible thick Swamps and Morasses. For this Reason,
the only Method of travelling is in Bark Canoes, or very light Battoes,
along the Rivers, which may be easily carried on Men's Shoulders, where
the Stream of the River becomes too rapid, and from one River to
another; for which Purpose the shortest Passes are always chosen, and
are called, for this Reason, Carrying Places.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> marched from <i>la Chine</i>, in the south End of
the Island of <i>Montreal</i>, the fourth of <i>July</i>. He divided five hundred
<i>Indians</i> so, that the greatest Number of them should always be in the
Van, which consisted of two Battalions of the regular Troops. They were
followed by the Canoes which carried the Provisions. The Van was
commanded by the Chevalier <i>de Callieres</i>, Governor of <i>Montreal</i>; he
had with him two large Battoes, which carried two small Pieces of
Cannon, small Mortars, Granadoes, and the Utensils of the Artillery. The
Count <i>de Frontenac</i> was at the Head of the main Body, accompanied by
the Engineer and several Gentlemen Voluntiers. The Body consisted of
four Battalions of the Militia, who, in War with <i>Indians</i>, were then
more depended on than the regular Troops; these were commanded by
Monsieur <i>Ramsay</i>, Governor of <i>Trois Rivieres</i>. The Rear, which
consisted of two Battalions of regular Troops, and of the rest of the
<i>Indians</i>, was under the Command of the Chevalier <i>de Vaudreuil</i>. All
the <i>Indians</i> had <i>French</i> Officers set over them.</p>

<p>In this Order the Army marched, only those that were in the Van one Day,
were in the Rear the next; and they always kept a Number of <i>Indians</i> on
the Scout, to discover the Tracks of the Enemy, for fear of Ambuscades.
And when they were obliged to carry the Canoes, and drag the large
Battoes, several Parties were detached to cover the Men that worked.</p>

<p>After twelve Days March they arrived at <i>Cadarackui Fort</i>, one hundred
eighty Miles from <i>Montreal</i>. Here they waited for the <i>Utawawas</i>, who
disappointed them; and in the mean Time raised a Bark, which had
remained sunk since <i>Cadarackui Fort</i> was deserted. They crossed over
<i>Cadarackui</i> Lake to <i>Onondaga</i> River (now <i>Ohswega</i>). This River being
narrow and rapid, they ordered fifty Men to march on each Side of it, to
prevent their being surprised, and the Army moved slowly along the
River, according to the Intelligence they received from their Scouts.
They found a Tree, as they passed along, on which the <i>Indians</i> had, in
their Manner, painted the <i>French</i> Army, and had laid by it two Bundles
of cut Rushes. This was a Defiance in the <i>Indian</i> Manner, and to tell
them by the Number of Rushes, that fourteen hundred thirty four Men
would meet them. The <i>French</i> passed the little Lake, between <i>Ohswega</i>
and <i>Onondaga</i>, in Order of Battle; and the two Wings, to prevent their
being surprised, and to make the Place of their Landing more uncertain
to the Enemy, took a Circuit along the Coast. As soon as they had landed
they raised a Fort. A <i>Seneka</i>, who had been some time a Prisoner in
<i>Canada</i>, and pretended an Attachment to the <i>French</i>, was sent out to
make a Discovery. He deserted to the <i>Onondagas</i>. He found them waiting
for the <i>French</i>, with a Resolution to defend their Castle, and to fight
the <i>French</i>; for which Purpose they had sent away their Women and
Children. The <i>Seneka</i> told them that the <i>French</i> Army was as numerous
as the Leaves on the Trees; that they had Machines which threw Balls up
in the Air, and which falling on their Castle burst to Pieces, and
spread Fire and Death every where, against which their Stockadoes could
be of no Defence. This was confirmed by another <i>Seneka</i>, who deserted.
Upon which the <i>Onondagas</i> thought it most adviseable to retire, leaving
their poor Fort and bark Cottages all in Flames.</p>

<p>After the General had an Account of this, he marched to their Village in
Order of Battle. The Army was divided into two Lines: The first
commanded by the Chevalier <i>de Callieres</i>, who placed himself on the
Left, consisted of two Battalions of the Inhabitants in the Center, and
a Battalion of the regular Troops on each Wing. The Artillery followed
them. Most of the <i>Indians</i> of this Division were upon the Right, who
continually sent out Scouts. The second Line was commanded by the
Chevalier <i>de Vaudreuel</i>, composed of the same Number of Battalions, and
in the same Order. The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> was carried in a Chair
directly after the Artillery. But it was impossible for them to keep
their Order, in passing through thick Woods, and in passing Brooks. In
this formidable Manner the aged General marched up to the Ashes of the
Village, and his Army exerted their Fury on the <i>Indian</i> Corn, which
covered a large Field in thick Ranks.</p>

<p>An <i>Indian Sachem</i>, about one hundred Years old, would not retire with
the rest, but chose this Time to end his Days. The <i>French Indians</i> had
the Pleasure of tormenting him, which he bore with surprising Evenness
of Mind, and with that Resolution which becomes a <i>Sachem</i> of the <i>Five
Nations</i>. He told his Tormentors to remember well his Death, when his
Countrymen should come to take terrible Vengeance of them. Upon which,
one stabbing him several Times with his Knife, he thanked him but said,
you had better make me die by Fire, that these Dogs of <i>Frenchmen</i> may
learn how to suffer like Men. You <i>Indians</i>, their Allies, you Dogs of
Dogs, think of me when you shall be in the like State. Thus this old
<i>Sachem</i>, under all the Weakness of old Age, preserved a Greatness of
Soul, and a due Regard for the Honour of his Country, to the last Moment
of his Breath.</p>

<p>The Chevalier <i>de Vaudreuil</i> was sent with a Detachment of six or seven
hundred Men to destroy the <i>Oneydoes</i> Corn, who liv'd but a small
Distance from <i>Onondaga</i>, which he performed without any Resistance. The
Jesuit <i>Milet</i> had lived for the most Part with the <i>Oneydoes</i>; he had
infused into them the most favourable Sentiments of the <i>French</i>, and
they had been the most inclined to Peace on the <i>French</i> Terms. Thirty
five of them staid in their Castle to make the <i>French</i> welcome; but the
only Favour they obtained, was to be made Prisoners, and carried to
<i>Montreal</i>. The <i>French</i> Governor declared his Resolutions to extirpate
the <i>Onondagas</i>, and for that Reason gave Orders to give no Quarter.</p>

<p>The Difficulty of supporting so many Men in these Deserts, made it
necessary for the Count <i>de Frontenac</i> to return as speedily as
possible. Though the <i>French</i> Army was much an Overmatch for the
<i>Onondagas</i>, both in Number of Men and in their Arms, the <i>Onondagas</i>
were not so far dispirited, as not to follow them in their Return. They
found Opportunities to revenge themselves in some Measure, by cutting
off every Canoe that happened at any Time to be at a Distance from the
main Body. This obliged the Count to hasten his March, so that he
returned to <i>Montreal</i> the tenth of <i>August</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Onondagas</i> suffered nothing by this chargeable Expedition, but the
Loss of their Corn, and their Bark Cottages. They lost not one Man, but
the old <i>Sachem</i>, who resolved to die a Martyr to his Country's Honour.
The <i>French</i> suffered considerably by its Consequences; for all the
Planters being taken off from their Labour, either in this Expedition,
or in watching and securing their Forts and Country, a Famine ensued;
and this I find has often happened in <i>Canada</i>, where all the Men, fit
to bear Arms, have been employed in such like Expeditions. If the
<i>Oneydoes</i> had not timely surrendered themselves, the Count had not been
able to have carried Home the least Token of a Victory. And all that can
be said for this Enterprize is, that it was a kind of heroick Dotage.</p>

<p>The Influence that the Jesuit <i>Milet</i> had obtained over the <i>Oneydoes</i>
was such, that some Time after this, thirty of them deserted to the
<i>French</i>, and desired that he might be appointed their Pastor.</p>

<p>In the following Winter the <i>Mohawks</i>, with the Governor of <i>New York</i>'s
Privacy, <b>sent one to the <i>Praying Indians</i> with two Belts</b>, and he
carried two Prisoners with him. By the first Belt he asked, whether the
Path was entirely shut up between their two Countries; and, by the
second, demanded the Restitution of a Prisoner the <i>Praying Indians</i> had
taken: But his real Design was, to learn the State of their Country, and
what Designs were forming. Notwithstanding the Influence and Artifice of
the <i>French</i> Priests over these Converts, they still retained an
Affection to their Countrymen; for which Reason the Count <i>de Frontenac</i>
entertained a Jealousy of these Intercourses, and threatened to put to
Death any that should come in that Manner again; but the Messenger had
the Satisfaction of discovering the distressed Condition of <i>Canada</i> by
Famine.</p>

<p>A Party of the <i>French</i> was sent out in the Winter, to make some Attempt
upon the <i>English</i> Settlements near <i>Albany</i>; but some <i>Mohawks</i> and
<i>Scahkook Indians</i> meeting with them, before they reached the
Settlements, they were intirely routed. The commanding Officer, one <i>du
Bau</i>, and two others, saved themselves from the Fury of the <i>Indians</i>,
by running to <i>Albany</i>; the rest were either killed or perished in the
Woods, so that not one Man of this Party got back to <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>It was much easier for the <i>French</i> to set the <i>Praying Indians</i> upon
the <i>English</i>, against whom it is possible many of them had personal
Animosities, that made them go over to the <i>French</i>, than to fight their
Countrymen. Several of them came this Winter skulking about
<i>Schenectady</i> and <i>Albany</i>; and being well acquainted with the Country,
and speaking likewise the <i>Mohawk</i>'s Language, by which they sometimes
deceived the Inhabitants, they surprised some of the Inhabitants, and
carried away their Scalps.</p>

<p>The <i>Five Nations</i>, to shew that the Count <i>de Frontenac</i>'s Expedition
had no Way discouraged them, sent out several Parties against <i>Canada</i>.
One of them met with a Party of <i>French</i> upon <i>St. Laurence River</i>, near
<i>Montreal</i>. The <i>French</i> were routed, and their Captain killed. As soon
as this was heard at <i>Montreal</i>, <i>Repentigni</i> was sent out after them
with a considerable Party of <i>French</i>, <i>Nepicirinien Indians</i> and
<i>Praying Indians</i>; but this Party was likewise defeated, and the
Captain, with many of his Men, killed.</p>

<p>Thus the War was continued till the Peace of <i>Reswick</i>, by small Parties
of <i>Indians</i>, on both Sides, harassing, surprising, and scalping the
Inhabitants near <i>Montreal</i> and <i>Albany</i>.</p>

<p>Some Time this Year the chief <i>Sachem</i> of the <i>Dionondadies</i> (whom the
<i>French</i> call the <i>Baron</i>) went to <i>Quebeck</i>, pretending a strong
Attachment to the <i>French</i>, but really to conceal the Treaty of Peace
that he was on the Point of concluding with the <i>Five Nations</i>; for
which Purpose he had <b>sent his Son with nineteen Belts</b> to the <i>Senekas</i>.
The Substance of whose Commission was as follows:</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> have for many Years confounded our Resolutions, and
deceived us, but now we are resolved to break all their Artifices, by
stopping our Ears. We come now to unite with you, while the <i>French</i>
know nothing of the Matter. The Commandant at <i>Missilimakinak</i> has told
us many Lies, he has betrayed us, and made us kill one another, but we
are firmly resolved never to hearken to him any more. The Peace was
accordingly firmly concluded, notwithstanding all the Opposition the
<i>French</i> could make. The <i>French</i> Authors say, the only Reason that
induced the <i>Dionondadies</i> was, that the <i>English</i> sold them Goods
cheaper than the <i>French</i> could.</p>

<p>Some Time before the News of the Peace arrived, the <i>French</i> at
<i>Montreal</i> being informed that a Party of the <i>Five Nations</i> were
discovered near <i>Corlear's Lake</i>, sent out a Captain with a Party of
Soldiers and <i>Indians</i>, who being well experienced in the Manner of
making War with <i>Indians</i>, marched through the thickest Woods, and by
the least frequented Places, so that he discovered the Enemy, without
being discovered. He surprised that Party, killed several, and took one
Prisoner. The <i>Utawawas</i> being then trading at <i>Montreal</i>, the Count
<i>de Frontenac</i> invited them to a Feast to be made of this Prisoner, and
caused him to be burnt publickly alive at <i>Montreal</i>, in the Manner of
which I have already given two Accounts from the <i>French</i> Authors.</p>


<br /><br /><br /><br />
<h2><a name="CHAP_2_XIII" id="CHAP_2_XIII"></a>CHAP. XIII.</h2>

<h4><i>The Conduct which the</i> English <i>and</i> French <i>observed</i>, <i>in regard to
the</i> Five Nations, <i>immediately after the Peace of</i> Reswick.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>oon after the News of the Peace of <i>Reswick</i> reached <i>New-York</i>, the
Governor sent an Express to <i>Canada</i>, to inform the Governor there of
it, that Hostilities might cease. The <i>Five Nations</i> having an Account
of the Peace earlier than they had it in <i>Canada</i>, took Advantage of it,
in hunting Bever near <i>Cadarackui Fort</i>. The Governor of <i>Canada</i> being
informed of this, and believing that the <i>Five Nations</i> thought
themselves secure by the general Peace, resolved to take his last
Revenge of them. For this Purpose he sent a considerable Party of
<i>Adirondacks</i> to surprise them, which they did, and killed several, but
not without Loss of many of their own Men. The Loss of one of their
greatest Captains at that Time gave the <i>Five Nations</i> the greatest
Affliction. After he was mortally wounded, he cried out: "Must I, who
have made the whole Earth tremble before me, now die by the Hands of
Children?" for he despised the <i>Adirondacks</i>.</p>

<p>A Dispute at this Time arose, between the Government of <i>New-York</i> and
<i>Canada</i>, about the <i>French</i> Prisoners which the <i>Five Nations</i> had in
their Hands. The Earl of <i>Bellamont</i>, then Governor of <i>New-York</i>, would
have the <i>French</i> receive those Prisoners from him, and directed the
<i>Five Nations</i> to bring them to <i>Albany</i> for that Purpose. The <i>French</i>,
on the other Hand, refused to own the <i>Five Nations</i> as subject to the
Crown of <i>Great-Britain</i>, and threatened to continue the War against the
<i>Five Nations</i>, if they did not bring the Prisoners to <i>Montreal</i>, and
deliver them there. The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> sent some of the <i>Praying
Indians</i> with a Message to this Purpose, and to have all the <i>French</i>
Allies included in the general Peace.</p>

<p>The Messenger on his Return told the Count, publickly in Presence of
several <i>Utawawas</i>, that the <i>Five Nations</i> refused to include several
of his Allies, but were resolved to revenge the Injuries they had
received. The <i>Utawawas</i> were exceedingly discomposed at hearing this,
and the Count, to recover their Spirits, assured them, that he never
would make Peace without including all his Allies in it, and without
having all their Prisoners restored. At the same Time he made
Preparations to attack the <i>Five Nations</i> with the whole Force of
<i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>The Earl of <i>Bellamont</i> being informed of this, sent Captain <i>John
Schuyler</i> (of the Militia) to tell the Count, that he had the Interest
of the King his Master too much at Heart, to suffer the <i>French</i> to
treat the <i>Five Nations</i> like Enemies, after the Conclusion of the
general Peace; for which Reason he had ordered them to be on their
Guard, and had furnished them with Arms and Ammunition; that he had
ordered the Lieutenant-Governor, in Case they were attacked, either by
the <i>French</i> or their Allies, to join them with the regular Troops; and
that, if he found it necessary, he would raise the whole Force of his
Government in their Defence.</p>

<p>This put a Stop to the <i>French</i> Threatening, and both Sides made
Complaint to their Masters. The two Kings ordered their respective
Governors to be assisting to each other, in making the Peace effectual
to both Nations, and to leave the Disputes, as to the Dependency of the
<i>Indian Nations</i>, to be determined by Commissioners, to be appointed
pursuant to the Treaty of <i>Reswick</i>.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly impolitick, when weaker Potentates, ingaged in a
Confederacy against one powerful Prince, leave any Points to be
determined after the Conclusion of a Peace; for if they cannot obtain a
Concession, while the Confederacy stands and their Force is united, how
can a weaker Prince hope to obtain it, when he is left alone to himself,
after the Confederacy is dissolved? The <i>French</i> have so often found the
Benefit of this Piece of Imprudence, that in all their Treaties they use
all the Cajoling, and every Artifice in their Power, to obtain this
Advantage, and they seldom miss it.</p>

<p>About the Time of the Conclusion of the Peace at <i>Reswick</i>, the noted
<i>Therouet</i> died at <i>Montreal</i>. The <i>French</i> gave him Christian Burial in
a pompous Manner, the Priest, that attended him at his Death, having
declared that he died a true Christian; for, said the Priest, while I
explained to him the Passion of our Saviour, whom the <i>Jews</i> crucified,
he cried out; "Oh! had I been there, I would have revenged his Death,
and brought away their Scalps."</p>

<p>Soon after the Peace was known at <i>Montreal</i>, three considerable Men of
the <i>Praying Indians</i> came to <i>Albany</i>; they had fine laced Coats given
them, and were invited to return to their own Country. They answered,
that they were young Men, and had not Skill to make a suitable Answer,
and had not their ancient Men to consult with; but promised to
communicate the Proposals to their old Men, and would bring back an
Answer in the Fall. I find nothing more of this in the Register of
<i>Indian Affairs</i>, though it might have been of great Consequence had it
been pursued to Purpose; but such Matters, where there is not an
immediate private Profit, are seldom pursued by the <i>English</i> with that
Care and Assiduity, with which they are by the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>While Captain <i>Schuyler</i> was in <i>Canada</i>, he entered into some
indiscreet Discourse with Monsieur <i>Maricour</i>, for whom the <i>Five
Nations</i> had a particular Esteem, and call <i>Stowtowisse</i>. Captain
<i>Schuyler</i>, in asserting the Dependency of the <i>Five Nations</i> on
<i>New-York</i>, said, that those Nations were their Slaves. Mr. <i>Maricour</i>
told this Discourse to an <i>Onondaga</i>, with all the Aggravations he
could, and added, that it was intirely owing to the <i>English</i> that the
Peace was not absolutely concluded, and that Captain <i>Schuyler</i>
prevented their Prisoners being restored, because he would have them
sent to <i>Albany</i>, as being Slaves to the <i>English</i>. That the <i>French</i>
had no Dispute with the <i>English</i>, but for the Independency of the <i>Five
Nations</i>. This indiscreet Conduct of Captain <i>Schuyler</i> was so much
resented by the <i>Five Nations</i>, that a Deputation of the most
considerable <i>Sachems</i> was sent to <i>Albany</i> in <i>June</i> 1699, to complain
of it; and they sent at the same Time Deputies to <i>Canada</i> to conclude
the Peace, independently of the <i>English</i>. These Deputies that came to
<i>Albany</i> were so far convinced that the <i>French</i> had abused them, and
how much more it was for their Security to be included in the general
Peace with the <i>English</i>, than to have only the <i>French</i> Faith for their
Security, that they immediately dispatched a Messenger after their
Deputies that were gone to <i>Canada</i>. Though this Messenger reached them
too late to stop their Proceeding, it convinced the Deputies so far of
its being for their Interest to be joined with the <i>English</i> in the
Peace, as they had been in the War, that they insisted that the
Exchange of Prisoners be made at <i>Albany</i>. At the same Time the
Messenger was sent after their Deputies to <i>Canada</i>, Colonel <i>Peter
Schuyler</i> was sent with others to <i>Onondaga</i>, to remove the Prejudices
they had received there.</p>

<p>The Count <i>de Frontenac</i> died while these Disputes continued. Monsieur
<i>de Callieres</i>, who succeeded him, put an End to them, by agreeing to
send to <i>Onondaga</i> to regulate the Exchange of Prisoners there; for
which Purpose Monsieur <i>Maricour</i>, <i>Ioncaire</i>, and the Jesuit <i>Bruyas</i>,
were sent.</p>

<p>When the <i>French</i> Commissioners were come within less than a Mile of
<i>Onondaga</i> Castle, they put themselves in Order and marched with the
<i>French</i> Colours carried before them, and with as much Show as they
could make. <i>Decanesora</i> met them without the Gate, and <b>complimented
them with three Strings of Wampum</b>. By the first he wiped away their
Tears for the <i>French</i> that had been slain in the War. By the second he
opened their Mouths, that they might speak freely; that is, promised
them Freedom of Speech. By the third he cleaned the Matt, on which they
were to sit, from the Blood that had been spilt on both Sides: The
Compliment was returned by the Jesuit, then they entered the Fort, and
were saluted with a general Discharge of all the fire Arms. They were
carried to the best Cabin in the Fort, and there entertained with a
Feast. The Deputies of the several Nations not being all arrived, the
Jesuit, and Monsieur <i>Maricour</i>, passed the Time in visiting and
conversing with the <i>French</i> Prisoners. The General Council being at
last met, the Jesuit made the following Speech, which I take from the
Relation the <i>Five Nations</i> afterwards made of it to the Earl of
<i>Bellamont</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"1. I am glad to see the <i>Five Nations</i>, and that some of them
went to <i>Canada</i>, notwithstanding <i>Corlear</i> forbid them: I am
sorry for the Loss of your People killed by the remote
<i>Indians</i>; I condole their Death, and wipe away the Blood by
this Belt.</p>

<p>"2. The War Kettle boiled so long, that it would have scalded
all the <i>Five Nations</i> had it continued; but now it is overset,
and turned upside down, and a firm Peace made.</p>

<p>"3. I now plant the Tree of Peace and Welfare at <i>Onondaga</i>.</p>

<p>"4. Keep fast the Chain you have made with <i>Corlear</i>, for now we
have one Heart and one Interest with them; but why is <i>Corlear</i>
against your corresponding with us, ought we not to converse
together when we are at Peace and in Friendship?</p>

<p>"5. Deliver up the <i>French</i> Prisoners you have, and we shall
deliver not only those of your Nation we have, but all those
likewise taken by any of our Allies; and gave a Belt.</p>

<p>"6. I offer myself to you to live with you at <i>Onondaga</i>, to
instruct you in the Christian Religion, and to drive away all
Sickness, Plagues and Diseases out of your Country, and gave a
third Belt.</p>

<p>"7. This last Belt, he said, is from the <i>Rondaxe</i>, or <i>French
Indians</i>, to desire Restitution of the Prisoners taken from
them."</p>

<p>The Jesuit in the Conclusion said; "Why does not <i>Corlear</i> tell
you what passes between the Governor of <i>Canada</i> and him? He
keeps you in the Dark, while the Governor of <i>Canada</i> conceals
nothing from his Children. Nor does the Governor of <i>Canada</i>
claim your Land, as <i>Corlear</i> does."</p></div>


<p>The General Council immediately rejected the Belt by which the Jesuit
offered to stay with them, saying, We have already accepted <i>Corlear's</i>
Belt, by which he offers us Pastors to instruct us. <i>Decanesora</i> added,
The Jesuits have always deceived us, for while they preached Peace, the
<i>French</i> came and knocked us on the Head. To this the Jesuit replied,
that if he had known that <i>Corlear</i> intended to send them Pastors, he
would not have offered this Belt.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the <i>Indian</i> Council refused to hear the
<i>French</i>, or to give them an Answer, but in Presence of the
Commissioners from <i>Albany</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> Commissioners having assured the Peace with the <i>Five
Nations</i>, the Inhabitants of <i>Canada</i> esteemed it the greatest Blessing
that could be procured for them from Heaven; for nothing could be more
terrible than this last War with the <i>Five Nations</i>. While this War
lasted, the Inhabitants eat their Bread in continual Fear and Trembling.
No Man was sure, when out of his House, of ever returning to it again.
While they laboured in the Fields, they were under perpetual
Apprehensions of being killed or seized, and carried to the <i>Indian</i>
Country, there to end their Days in cruel Torments. They many Times were
forced to neglect both their Seed Time and Harvest. The Landlord often
saw all his Land plundered, his Houses burnt, and the whole Country
ruined, while they thought their Persons not safe in their
Fortifications. In short, all Trade and Business was often at an intire
Stand, while Fear, Despair, and Misery appeared in the Faces of the poor
Inhabitants.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> Commissioners carried several of the principal <i>Sachems</i> of
the <i>Five Nations</i> back with them, who were received at <i>Montreal</i> with
great Joy. They were saluted by a Discharge of all the great Guns round
the Place, as they entered. The <i>French</i> Allies took this amiss, and
asked if their Governor was entering. They were told, that it was a
Compliment paid to the <i>Five Nations</i>, whose <i>Sachems</i> were then
entering the Town. We perceive, they replied, that Fear makes the
<i>French</i> shew more Respect to their Enemies, than Love can make them do
to their Friends.</p>

<p>Monsieur <i>de Callieres</i> assembled all the <i>French</i> Allies, (who were
then very numerous at <i>Montreal</i>) to make the Exchange of Prisoners, and
they delivered the Prisoners they had taken, though the <i>Five Nations</i>
had sent none to be exchanged for them. Thus we see a brave People
struggle with every Difficulty, till they can get out of it with Honour;
and such People always gain Respect, even from their most inveterate
Enemies.</p>

<p>I shall finish this Part by observing, that notwithstanding the <i>French</i>
Commissioners took all the Pains possible to carry Home the <i>French</i>,
that were Prisoners with the <i>Five Nations</i>, and they had full Liberty
from the <i>Indians</i>, few of them could be persuaded to return. It may be
thought that this was occasioned from the Hardships they had endured in
their own Country, under a tyrannical Government and a barren Soil: But
this certainly was not the only Reason; for the <i>English</i> had as much
Difficulty to persuade the People, that had been taken Prisoners by the
<i>French Indians</i>, to leave the <i>Indian</i> Manner of living, though no
People enjoy more Liberty, and live in greater Plenty, than the common
Inhabitants of <i>New-York</i> do. No Arguments, no Intreaties, nor Tears of
their Friends and Relations, could persuade many of them to leave their
new <i>Indian</i> Friends and Acquaintance; several of them that were by the
Caressings of their Relations persuaded to come Home, in a little Time
grew tired of our Manner of living, and run away again to the <i>Indians</i>,
and ended their Days with them. On the other Hand, <i>Indian</i> Children
have been carefully educated among the <i>English</i>, cloathed and taught,
yet, I think, there is not one Instance, that any of these, after they
had Liberty to go among their own People, and were come to Age, would
remain with the <i>English</i>, but returned to their own Nations, and became
as fond of the <i>Indian</i> Manner of Life as those that knew nothing of a
civilized Manner of living. What I now tell of Christian Prisoners among
<i>Indians</i>, relates not only to what happened at the Conclusion of this
War, but has been found true on many other Occasions.</p>

they are wove as broad as one's Hand, and about two Feet long; these
they call Belts, and give and receive at their Treaties as the Seals of
Friendship; for lesser Matters a single String is given. Every Bead is

they owed the Christians. These <i>Indians</i> are all profess'd Papists, and

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
